<p>The ID card debate is on Monday, and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4100629.stm">Clarke intends to press on with Blunkett&rsquo;s white elephant</a>, so:</p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/?pid=10124">Iain</a>,</p>

<p>I am writing to you to urge you to speak out against the proposed national ID card scheme in Monday&rsquo;s debate. ID cards do not stop terrorism. David Blunkett himself said &ldquo;I accept that it is important that we do not pretend that an entitlement card would be an overwhelming factor in combating international terrorism.&rdquo;[<a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-61875&amp;als%5Btheme%5D=National%20ID%20Cards#terrorism">1</a>] ID cards do not make society a safer place. According to police forces in this country and others, lack of identification is not the major problem in combating crime[<a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-61881&amp;als%5Btheme%5D=National%20ID%20Cards#6">2</a>].</p>

<p>ID cards do cost a lot of money. The £5 to £7 (£420m over 60m people) quoted by the home office does not take into account many hidden costs. Michael Howard&rsquo;s proposal in 1996 cost two to three times as much. Australia&rsquo;s system doubled in price after the project was started, finally topping AUS$820[<a href="http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-61881&amp;als%5Btheme%5D=National%20ID%20Cards#5%22">3</a>] (£320m over 20m people). ID cards will increase the crisis caused by growing identity fraud[<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2637927.stm">4</a>]. No system is ever completely foolproof, the ID card introduces a single point of failure, instead of the distributed system we have currently.</p>

<p>As my representative in Government, please don&rsquo;t burden me with extra expenditure and invasion of my privacy in the name of enhanced security by implementing a proposal that can not achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
