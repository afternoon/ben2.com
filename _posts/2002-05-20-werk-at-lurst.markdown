<p>Finally got some actual work done as a contractor! Apart from a near-constant stream of changes to Certa I haven&rsquo;t actually done anything for a while. However, last week I got my first job as a usability consultant.</p>
<p>Basically I evaluated (clicked-on) a web site and wrote down how I felt (angry, less angry, exstatic). At the end I wrote a report. The report was quite interesting. I separated it into problems and suggested solutions so hopefully it was quite useful from an implementation point of view. I like being a consultant, but report writing is a brain-taxing thing to do.</p>
