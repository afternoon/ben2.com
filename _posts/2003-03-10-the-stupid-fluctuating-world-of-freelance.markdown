<p>It seems like a cycle. Depression and dispair at lack of money and time to make money comes at the end of a project, then I start to look at removing myself from the freelance scene by way of some kind of gainful employment. Then, before that really kicks in, things pick up and my optimism returns and blinds me to the fact that in another month I&rsquo;m going to be fucked again!</p>
<p>Today I have arranged 2 meetings in April that may yield work, one looks about as certain as it can do on the first day. Also I should leave now as I have an interview at <a href="http://www.lateral.net">Lateral</a>, a web agency.</p>
<p>Of course I haven&rsquo;t finished the work I <b>must</b> finish before pissing off to NY a week today.</p>
<p>A week today! I&rsquo;m all excited!</p>
