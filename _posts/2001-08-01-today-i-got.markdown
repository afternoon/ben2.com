<p>OS X is neat. It&rsquo;s still a strange beast. I had the beta for a few days when that was around, but only on an iMac. Now I have it as my main operating system on a beautiful bang up-to-date turquoise G3 at 350mhz. It crawls a bit. It would be nice if it was a bit more responsive.</p>
<p>My main problem is that it rather looks down it&rsquo;s nose at trad AppleTalk, &ldquo;the NBP flavour&rdquo; of which is handily used by all my OS 8/9 work mates to send files whizzing everywhere. I would say it an outrageous oversight, but I&rsquo;m happy to find a hack for the other bits. True I haven&rsquo;t seen Fireworks or Dreamweaver all day, I currently have no classic environment. To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure my machine is up to it, despite having 400+mb of RAM. However, I can see some remote machines, fairly recent OS-ed ones, so I&rsquo;ll concentrate on them. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll get samba going and that will give me access to our office fileserver. Doh.</p>
<p>Places to look are hard to find, it&rsquo;s another alien web community to get into. I just skimmed the surface of the Classic world. Hey, I haven&rsquo;t gone to tucows yet. <a href="http://www.osxfaq.com/">OS X FAQ</a> looks handy. <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/index.shtml">Versiontracker</a> has a big collection of OS X software.</p>
