<p>If you ever want to get me involved in a discussion, or to agree to something, get me to ride to you and give me a milky cup of coffee.</p>
<p>I ride to work each day, about seven miles each way. I got in at 10:30 this morning (bit later than usual). I shower and get to work. The other people in my office are having a meeting, so coffee was prepared. After downing a cup of milky coffee and still coasting high on the endorphins from riding in the chill autumn morning and showering, I get <em>really enthusiastic</em> about stuff. It&rsquo;s quite funny.</p>
