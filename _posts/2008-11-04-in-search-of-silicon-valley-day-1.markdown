<p>I&rsquo;m a London-based developer and startup founder. I&rsquo;ve come to the San Francisco Bay Area to find Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I flew in yesterday, found my hotel via BART and a MUNI bus. I&rsquo;m close to Union Square, at the heart of SF.</p>
<p>My plan is to hit as many free networking events as possible. The big one is the LobbyCon at the <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/web2008/public/content/home">Web 2.0 Summit</a>. The lobby of the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, is ground zero for people without the $3,900 for a ticket to the full summit. I did the same thing at the Web 2.0 Expo Europe in Berlin in October and met some great people.</p>
<p>Today it&rsquo;s the <a href="http://mobile2event.com/">Mobile 2.0 event</a>. The ticket price has kept me away thus far, but I&rsquo;m heading down there now to network at the reception.</p>
<p>Before I arrived I asked some people in my London network for Bay Area contacts. I just posted a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/business-travel/travel-tools/BTV_TVT/356879-4314509?browseIdx=0&amp;sik=1225760906135&amp;goback=%2Eamq">LinkedIn question</a> to try to elicit other suggestions from my network and the wider LinkedIn community.</p>
