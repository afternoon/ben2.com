<p>So Netscape is gone, that&rsquo;s bad news for them, but not for Mozilla happily. It will continue apace. Their timing couldn&rsquo;t be better almost. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> site has been redesigned. The new site is very good. It&rsquo;s simple and usable and it&rsquo;s attractive and very business-like. It seems to be eager to take on the mantle of the challenger that PPK would give it. Moz needs to learn a few lessons from Opera about impressing the suits.</p>
<p>The new site is a big step in the right direction if Mozilla is to climb to the top. In addition, I really think that the totally refactored codebases cut from the main trunk, the children of Moz if you like, Firebird, Thunderbird and Camino, represent the way forward for the newly formed foundation. These products fit into the bigger world of the web much better than the monolithic main product. They are more evolved and much fitter challengers to IE.</p>
