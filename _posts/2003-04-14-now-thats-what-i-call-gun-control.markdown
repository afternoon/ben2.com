<p>In the UK it&rsquo;s illegal to possess a hand gun of any kind. We&rsquo;re introducing a minimum sentence of 5 years for people caught with them. We&rsquo;re also outlawing replica hand guns due to the number of people accidentally shot by paranoid police armed response teams.</p>
<p>I totally agree with this situation. Who cares that I can&rsquo;t hunt, hunting is not fun enough to justify the hundreds of deaths from shootings each year. Shooting is not fun enough either. I have no fear in my home, I don&rsquo;t need to defend myself, I&rsquo;m pretty confident that no-one&rsquo;s going to break in. Even if they did I would be much happier for them to steal all my stuff than have it escalate to armed conflict resulting, almost certainly, in me getting horribly wounded or killed. Lower the stakes, stop the proliferation.</p>
