<p>I&rsquo;m just talking to a client who&rsquo;s reviewing some changes I&rsquo;ve made to her site. She&rsquo;s going through the changes under her breath. The whole &ldquo;under her breath&rdquo; thing is a very similar experience to watching a status bar. You know that there&rsquo;s business being attended to, but if you try to work out what that business is, it&rsquo;ll just take twice as long.</p>
