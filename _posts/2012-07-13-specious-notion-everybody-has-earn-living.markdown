<blockquote>
  <p>We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn
  a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a
  technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of
  today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living.
  We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be
  employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian
  theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of
  inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors.
  The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about
  whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told
  them they had to earn a living.</p>
