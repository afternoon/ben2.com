<p>For my upcoming ALA article (man, saying that feels good, even if it doesn&rsquo;t get published), I would like to be able to draw on the feelings of major designers. To this end I&rsquo;m thinking about sending a simple questionnaire to the web teams responsible for a number of high profile sites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what the questions will be, but here&rsquo;s some rough ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why do you use <em>appropriate layout system</em> to layout <em>xyz.com</em>?</li>
<li><em>if the page is tables</em> Why don&rsquo;t you use CSS for layout? <em>CSS is very powerful. Is it because you don&rsquo;t know about CSS, don&rsquo;t know how to recreate your layout in CSS or some other reason?</em> <em>else if the page is CSS</em> Why don&rsquo;t you use tables? <em>They&rsquo;re tried and trusted</em></li>
<li>Why is design important for your site? <em>may get the answer &ldquo;because everybody else has it&rdquo; which would be fruitless</em></li>
<li>If you could change one thing about HTML+CSS to make it a little easier to do your job, what would that be?</li>
<li>Do the designers at your location design pages bottom-up by writing code or top-down, using tools such as Illustrator, Freehand, Photoshop or the Gimp?</li>
</ol>
<p>The other thing to think about is mentioning my ideas. If I say I want to put the grids back into web design, will that influence the answers? Probably. Do I want this? Not sure, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind feedback on my ideas from the people running the top sites on the net.</p>
