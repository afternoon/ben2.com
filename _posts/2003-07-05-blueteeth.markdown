<p>I got a Bluetooth dongle today. It&rsquo;s neat, installation was a case of sticking it in the USB port. My new phone (<a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/uk/spg.jsp?template=PS1&amp;B=ie&amp;PID=10055&amp;LM=PSM_V&amp;gal=105">Sony Ericsson T610</a>) has Bluetooth. It and the Mac totally love each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>iSync merged my calendars and contacts seemlessly</li>
<li>System Prefs picked up on the phone for use as a network interface</li>
<li>With the <a href="http://www.salling.com/">Salling Clicker</a>, I can remote control Mac apps through Applescript. It can detect when I go out of range and perform any action then</li>
<li>I can transfer sounds, themes and wallpapers on to the phone easily. I haven&rsquo;t opened Photoshop yet, but I will.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ahh, life is good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently listening to all my MP3&rsquo;s that have the word fuck in the title. About two and a half hours worth, heavily beefed up by two Chris LIberator mixes, one called <em>Clusterfuck</em> and the other called <em>It&rsquo;s Fuckin&rsquo; &lsquo;Avin It</em>. </p>
