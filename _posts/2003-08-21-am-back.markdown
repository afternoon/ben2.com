<p>But slack, I&rsquo;m warming up for a big &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo; post and of course I have photos, but for now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Italy was really nice, thanks Louisa and Alberto!</li>
<li>Being back is OK, could easily be much worse.</li>
<li>Louise was violently sick for hours on Monday, we had to go to A&amp;E. She&rsquo;s OK now though. Weirdness.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve just closed Gibson&rsquo;s <em>Pattern Recognition</em>. I liked it. Not as much as previous books maybe, but I&rsquo;m reserving judgement until when I&rsquo;m less tired. Certainly it was a page-turner and I&rsquo;ll always have time for his sense of cool. I want to go to Moscow!</li>
</ol>
