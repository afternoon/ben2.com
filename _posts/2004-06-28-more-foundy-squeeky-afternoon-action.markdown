<p>July 3rd, 3 - 7, and July 17th, 3 - 7.</p>

<p>So the question again is, what to play?</p>

<p>Last time I succeeded by quickly lowering my expectations of what I could achieve in a live setting. This time I should probably do the same. I&rsquo;m interested in performing with <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">Chuck</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t managed to get that to make much more a single continuous tone or bloopy effect yet, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that I can perform for four hours without seriously pissing off the clientele.</p>

<p>The safe option is to do what I did last time again, but with a bit more planning. Essentially compose a set list, rip those tunes to WAV, open in Live and mix with them in a sample like manner instead of standard beat matching. Probably should drink less this time as well.</p>

<p>I really want to try out cool fantastic stuff though. It all depends on how much time I get to set up. Last time I spent a few hours ripping tracks ahead of time and that wasn&rsquo;t enough. This time I already have tracks ripped so I can blow my frantic prep time on actually making loops and thinking about the set ahead of time. If I was being really organised, I would sit and play with Chuck a bit so that I could at least play around with it for half an hour. However, that would be quite a lot of time, and I have a busy week ahead of me.</p>

<p>It occurred to me during the week that I could combine Chuck and Max/MSP for some interesting effects. Create playing machines in Chuck and control them with Max/MSP knobs and dials that output midi. Might try that at some point.</p>
