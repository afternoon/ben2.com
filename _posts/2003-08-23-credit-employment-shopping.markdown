<p>I just applied for a <a href="http://www.barclaycard.co.uk/">Barclaycard</a>. I have credit issues for some reason. I&rsquo;ve never had a credit card and I&rsquo;ve never defaulted on a debt of any kind. I have a student loan but no other forms of finance. I have no idea why I have credit issues, but I got refused for a current account twice with <a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/">Smile</a> and once with <a href="http://www.cahoot.com/">Cahoot</a> a couple of times. I&rsquo;m hoping that if I can get a credit card then I can just use it as a delayed action debit card and that will help ingratiate me with the non-high street banks. I think that the reason I&rsquo;ve been turned down a couple of times is because the non-high streets have stricter policies regarding who they&rsquo;ll accept.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I don&rsquo;t get accepted for a Barclaycard I&rsquo;ll get one of the horrendous interest rate bad credit cards, like the <a href="http://www.capitalone.co.uk/">CapitalOne</a> one. I don&rsquo;t intend to keep a balance on it so what could possibly go wrong? :-)</p>
<p>Oh yes, <a href="http://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> didn&rsquo;t want me either. I&rsquo;m quite sad about this. I had just been thinking about how good it would be to work for them. I could have asked for a transfer anywhere in the world after a bit.</p>
<p>Earlier Louise and I went up to Portobello Road in Notting Hill. I&rsquo;ve never been there before. It&rsquo;s a famous antiques market. Today it seemed like just more of a market although there was a lot of antique stuff, old war memorobilia, Holmesian magnifying glasses, spoons, old cine stuff, a shop of crazy old sixties furniture, a gallery blasting Tone Loc and Wu Tang. All kinds of things. I think that all the real antiques trading is done in the early morning and that we missed it. It was pretty cool though and the rest of Notting Hill seemed very nice, even more ra! than Fulham. They were beginning to set up for the carnival - not as much as I expected though. I hope to attend aforementioned million-strong partay on Monday.</p>
