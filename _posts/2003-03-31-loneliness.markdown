<p>I&rsquo;m alone. It&rsquo;s completely quiet. Even the builders next door have shut up for once. All I can hear is the whine of my laptop and the sound of the keys. After being in the bustle of Manhattan and with Louise every moment for almost 2 weeks, it&rsquo;s sad to be alone in the quiet.</p>
<p>I think I may have to get a job just to get some friends.</p>
