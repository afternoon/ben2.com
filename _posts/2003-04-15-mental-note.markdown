<p>Tomcat likes to cache things. I&rsquo;ve just spent most of the afternoon trying to fix a bug which I thought was unfindable. I&rsquo;d fix it ages ago, but Tomcat had remembered it, oh yes. Probably shouldn&rsquo;t have been using a jar file at this point. I&rsquo;m sticking to classes from now on.</p>
