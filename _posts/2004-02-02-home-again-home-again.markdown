<p>Well, back to cold grey England, slightly dazed but getting into the routine again. I&rsquo;ve got work to do today indeed.</p>
<p>We got back on Friday morning at about nine, I delt with 1,297 emails and then passed out. Since then I&rsquo;ve been pottering around and spending a lot of time on my photo gallery.</p>
<p>On which note, I have hacked the gallery so that it paginates the list of galleries, so I can have more than ten, and uploaded the following sets of photos, finally:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/gallery/cricket/">Thickthorn and the cricket</a></li>
<li><a href="/gallery/louisesbirthday/">Louise&rsquo;s birthday</a></li>
<li><a href="/gallery/weatherproject/">The Weather Project at the Tate Modern</a></li>
<li><a href="/gallery/party/">The party</a>!</li>
<li><a href="/gallery/christmas/">Christmas</a></li>
<li><a href="/gallery/kenya/">Kenya</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>Blogs for the holiday to come in the next week or so. So much to tell!</p>
