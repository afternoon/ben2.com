<p>I just finished my first site of my second bout of freelancism. <a href="http://www.certasolutions.com">Certa Solutions</a> went live about half an hour ago. I didn&rsquo;t do the design, BTW, just the build.</p>
<p>Building the site I fell into the same patterns that I often do when building straight HTML. The effort of maintaining consistency between 40+ pages outweighs everything else. To this end I&rsquo;ve thought about converting all the content to XML and then building a set of XSL transformations to generate the site. Then the computer can do the repetive bit! Ha! The trick would then be to balance the content out between nodes - much easier than distributing it around one document.</p>
<p>I may try to rebuild Certa using this technique, but more likely I think I&rsquo;ll leave it until next time I have to do something similar. Hypothetical is a priority, and Fog needs a page which means rebuilding this site.</p>
<p>Also today I joined the <a href="http://smarty.php.net/">Smarty</a> mailing list and found out that my problems with it are not due to it, but my PHP build. Installing it on a more predictable BSD machine (this one) worked fine. Smarty is a template engine, the PHP teams measures to seperate logic from design. It&rsquo;s pretty fast, although I don&rsquo;t have the numbers for other systems like Zope or JSP. I&rsquo;m going to use it to provide theme support for Hype2.</p>
