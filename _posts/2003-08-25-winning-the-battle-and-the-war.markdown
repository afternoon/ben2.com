<p>My Emusic score is now 5.5Gb. Some 80 albums, of which I&rsquo;ve listened to about 15. I&rsquo;m going to run out of disk space of my laptop sometime next weekend.</p>
<p>We spent today up at Camden where Louise&rsquo;s parents had moored for the day. We got food from the market, which was fit, and pottered down the canal to Little Venice, about an hour round trip maybe. We explored the market a bit and did some clothes shopping. I nearly bought some trousers (they didn&rsquo;t have my size in the right colour, they&rsquo;re in another shop) and Louise nearly bought a skirt (she was too indecisive). Quite remarkable for us really. What with Portobello yesterday, the is the weekend for markets.</p>
<p>Watched Dickie Attenborough&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0075784">A Bridge Too Far</a></em> tonight. It was an awesome, huge war movie, with absolutely everybody in it. Really gritty as well, I almost cried and not because of a pull out all the stops schmolze ending, because it depicted a lot more of the really horrible bits of war accurately. I thought the <em>Thin Red Line</em> was good, but <em>A Bridge</em> trounces it.</p>
