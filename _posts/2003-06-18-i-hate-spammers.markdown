<p>I thought I hated them enough. I&rsquo;m now getting about 4 or 5 spam messages a day. Not too bad, I know, but it pisses me off enough. However, today I got a bunch of mailer daemon bounce messages from AOL because some bastard had used my address as the from and reply-to addresses on their Viagra spam.</p>
<p>Aaarrgghh! Everybody hates you! You are the worst, even worse than video games cheats! Please simply take you entire supply of Viagra yourself and explode your penis!</p>
