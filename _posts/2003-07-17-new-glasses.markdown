<p>I got my new glasses today. For the first time in a long time I&rsquo;m very aware of the fact that I&rsquo;m wearing glasses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d got ever so used to the framing of the world provided by the old pair and the new pair are quite different. They are much wider, which gives some things a crazy movie look. They are also  a fairly different prescription on the left side, which is disorienting and a little painful. I can&rsquo;t drive in them yet for this reason.</p>
<p>Stylistically, I haven&rsquo;t gone that far out there. It&rsquo;s just a big modernisation. I&rsquo;ve still got rims, but they&rsquo;re deeply rectangular, and they are designer (Calvin Klein of all things) rather than own-brand. They make my old glasses look distinctly shit, which I guess they were after all this time. It&rsquo;s funny, I&rsquo;d never really thought about it. My sunglasses are much worse and I&rsquo;d just sort of singled them out. However, now I&rsquo;ve upgraded a bit, I&rsquo;m well aware of how much better I look. Indeed, I&rsquo;m not planning to leave it so long before I upgrade again.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t upgraded my sunglasses yet, but given the change in the glasses, it will definitely be this weekend. I probably can&rsquo;t actually bring myself to put my current sunglasses on ever again.</p>
