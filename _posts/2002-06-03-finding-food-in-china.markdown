<p>The dream began with Louise and I in New York, but moved quickly to China - specifically Kowloon Bay or Gulong Bay or something similar. We were on a boat. I wanted to get food but we had no money, but we sailed around the harbour looking at the waterfront food places which were all selling noodles. In hindsight the scene is taken from buying food at Glastonbury a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>We went to get money and I think we went to a Girobank, or some other type of professional money organisation which you would not expect to find in China. The guy there, a big bearded man, said that I could buy cash with my card as long as I could show that I wasn&rsquo;t going to buy drugs. He gave me a form to complete. The form was great, including questions such as &ldquo;What was the first joke you heard?&rdquo; and, showing a figure of packages of tea, &ldquo;These teas all contain [some substance] which is derived from [coke or something]. What would you do with them?&rdquo; In the dream I knew to put something along the lines of &ldquo;Not buy them.&rdquo; In the end I bought Â£10 worth of Yen (yes, I know it&rsquo;s Juan in China). and we walked back out into the fray.</p>
