<p>I only went to see Hulk because of <a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,999941,00.html">Peter Bradshaw&rsquo;s review</a> in the Guardian. Before that I had pretty much dismissed it as cookie cutter action film territory. It wasn&rsquo;t really. Conversely, a lot of the red tops have dismissed with statements like &ldquo;Lee has tried to create a cerebral action movie&rdquo; (The Metro), but I don&rsquo;t think that covers it either.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to nail it down, but I think the best way to explain it is &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo;, a label only really <em>The Matrix</em> (not <em>Reloaded</em>) shares. It&rsquo;s no normal blockbuster, but it has all the raw grunt, more in fact. Hulk&rsquo;s smashing is ace, it really captures the total frustration. We&rsquo;re not asked to contemplate the world as it is/was/might be. Some people think that is the case, but I think it&rsquo;s just standard action plot fill, ignored in every other exploder, so why not this one?</p>
<p>Where X-Men 2 dissappointed my younger sister, this one will succeeded. It has all the childlike cool it could want and that&rsquo;s a good thing. And the ending is pure cheese genius. Absolute genius.</p>
