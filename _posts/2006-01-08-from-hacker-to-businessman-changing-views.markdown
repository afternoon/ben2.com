<p>I&rsquo;m a hacker. Hacking is my <em>raison d'etre</em> you might say. I come from the open source community side, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that my view of Bill Gates has never been that rosy.</p>
<p>I watched Bill&rsquo;s presentation from CES today. I thought it was a bit dull, nothing revolutionary there, but then it is a consumer crowd, rather than technologists so that&rsquo;s fair enough I guess.</p>
<p>But as I watched something strange happened. I had been reading yesterday about the Bill and Melinda Gates&rsquo; Foundation&rsquo;s support for the &ldquo;14 big health issues.&rdquo; As I watched him I thought about who this super rich man was, I noticed he was wearing quite a nice shirt. Age has improved his appearance vastly. I&rsquo;m a bit of a nervous presenter, so whenever I watch a smooth presentation I&rsquo;m always jealous. Then I realised that I have begun to respect Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Shock! Horror! I have friends (who may even comment) how out of sorts this is. It&rsquo;s quite revolutionary. The key of course is that this respect isn&rsquo;t for a fellow technologist, but for a businessman.</p>
<p>Of course, I was a young fool to be so dogmatic and blinkered in my unkindness towards Mr Gates, but at least I&rsquo;m starting to see more of the bigger picture.</p>
