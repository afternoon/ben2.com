<p>Bought a whole load of Electroclash tunes on Friday. Nice. I particularly recommend <em><a href="http://www.atouchofclassusa.com/atoc9001/a9001v.html">A Touch Of Class Sucks</a></em> for bits of rock, punk and disco all with a subtle electroclash flavour. I also bought the <em>Open Up And Say&hellip;@&lt;%_|^[!]</em> Tigerbeat6 sampler. Lots of good stuff coming out of that label at the moment. A particularly good track by DJ /rupture. I will have to investigate more I think&hellip;</p>
<p>Then yesterday I got a call saying the Chiswick Vision Express had the sunglasses I&rsquo;d liked back in. Having unsuccessfully tried to find more likeable pairs at the Oxford Street store on Friday, I went in, tried them on briefly and bought them on the spot. They even managed to make them up for me before they closed two hours later. I was late though and had to knock on the door to get in after they&rsquo;d closed. I haven&rsquo;t really worn them yet, but I&rsquo;ll let you know how great they are. The greatest thing so far is that because I spent so much on my normal glasses I got a voucher that gave me £70 off the sunglasses frames&hellip; which were £70! Woo! The lenses were only £80 as well. A pair of designer prescription sunglasses for £80! It&rsquo;s a deal.</p>
