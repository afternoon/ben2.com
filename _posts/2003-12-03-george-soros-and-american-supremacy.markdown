<p>George Soros has come out against Bush, big-time, effectively pledging as much cash as is required to defeat him. Soros has $7bn to play with.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2003/12/soros.htm">article by Soros attacking Bush&rsquo;s foreign policy</a>, published in the Atlantic, makes pretty interesting reading. As does a <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/12/1/1745/18873">K5 MLP post</a>, or, more specifically, the comments.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bumped into quite a lot of right-wing rhetoric recently. They throw a lot of mud at liberals. I guess the left wing throws a fair amount of mud back, but I find the right&rsquo;s attacks personal and disingenuous. Mat linked to the talking Ann Coulter doll today, eugh, the hideousness. As far as I&rsquo;m aware, Coulter has no role except to fling mud from the right-wing and she does so in a way which is often self-defeating.</p>
<p>However, such is the bitterness and unwavering power of right-wing comment, I find myself kind of lost at the moment politically. I have my basic beliefs, equality, freedom, but these words are practically hollow in the 21st century. Bush uses them more than anybody else. My problem is that I have no rhetoric, no verbal weapons to win an argument. If Ann Coulter turned up for a discussion tomorrow, she would kick my ass. I find this troubling.</p>
