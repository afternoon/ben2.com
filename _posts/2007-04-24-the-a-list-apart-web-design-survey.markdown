<p>At the risk of only posting other people&rsquo;s buttons, here&rsquo;s one for <a title="The Web Design Survey, 2007" href="http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey">A List Apart&rsquo;s Web Design Survey</a>.</p>
<p><a title="The Web Design Survey, 2007" href="http://alistapart.com/articles/webdesignsurvey"><img alt="" src="http://aneventapart.com/webdesignsurvey/templates/ala/images/i-took-the-2007-survey.gif"/></a></p>
<p>ALA make the valid point that little is known about web designers and developers as a group. Much is assumed, we&rsquo;re all nerdy young white males, of course! I for one look forward to the results.</p>
<p>Completing the survey gave me a chance to reflect on my 6-7 year career so far and consider it in context. I&rsquo;ve been very lucky, web design has been good to me in many ways. It&rsquo;s allowed me to be flexible about where I work, when and with whom. I&rsquo;m constantly improving my skillset (I ticked the box for every competency in the survey). I&rsquo;ve been able to play businessman in start-ups, entertaining my own ideas. Although that has sometimes been high-stress and low-income, I&rsquo;ve managed to find real jobs to fall back on when the going has got too tough.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m involved in not one but two exciting start-ups (<a href="http://mymart.com/">MyMart</a>, <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/">moblogUK</a>) and although it&rsquo;s a lot of work, they&rsquo;re both deeply interesting ventures. Reading <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a> and other sites the temptation to feel like an also-ran can be a bit strong sometimes. It&rsquo;s hard to watch lots of great services created by people younger than me spin-out for huge money. That&rsquo;s like holding yourself up against Hollywood stars or great statesmen and feeling like a failure. I need to remind myself not to do it and concentrate on just making great web applications.</p>
<p>P.S. My most recent act in this quest was to redesign the <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/">moblogUK home page</a> and create a new theme for the site. We&rsquo;ve launched some great new features (including one that is genuine bonafide innovative - busyness).</p>
