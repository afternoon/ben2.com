<p>Installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Panther</a> today. It&rsquo;s a bit of an anti-climax. Apple claim 150 features. It depends on what you would categorise as a feature really. I couldn&rsquo;t point to 150 things around the OS and say, &ldquo;hey, check this out, it&rsquo;s the coolest!&rdquo; In fact, there&rsquo;s only really Exposé that&rsquo;s worthy of that. Now there&rsquo;s a feature. I&rsquo;m going to have to see how it fits into my daily life really. And there we have it IMHO. Panther is not a wow OS, it&rsquo;s an evolution that is going to make my working life much easier. When it comes to things that are going to save me time, the list looks better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposé first of all, I mention it twice. It has three modes though and they&rsquo;re all cool.</li>
<li>Better file dialogs system-wide.</li>
<li>Save as dialogs allow you to click an old file to overwrite! Finally! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this all along, it&rsquo;s going to take a while before I remember I can do it.</li>
<li>Maximum mouse speed is much higher! Hooray!</li>
<li>Junk mail filtering is better in the new version of Mail. Only a little bit. But then only a little bit of my junk got through the old system.</li>
<li>Preview is faster than Acrobat Reader now and does haven&rsquo;t have Reader&rsquo;s long load time.</li>
<li>Much much faster interface all round. Windows are snappier, scrolling is faster, GUI mouse operations feel like less effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Finder I&rsquo;m not sure about. It doesn&rsquo;t really fit the way I use either Finder or hierarchical systems like Explorer or GMC etc. With Finder, I traditionally have a window for each folder, I know where those windows go and everything has it&rsquo;s place. With Explorer I have one window with which to view everything. That window stays where I put it and that makes me happy. With the new Finder I can kind of have one window, but if I double click a desktop folder ot connect to a server, a new window opens and it&rsquo;s the wrong place and it&rsquo;s the wrong size. This sounds pretty anal, but that&rsquo;s the way I use my file navigator.</p>
<p>The new mode of operation for connecting to CIFS/AFS shares looks pretty good, but I don&rsquo;t really connect to network machines that much.</p>
<p>Other than that, there&rsquo;s not a lot to report really. I get the feeling that I may well dig out more stuff over the next few days as I get back to work.</p>
