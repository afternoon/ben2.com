<p>DevShed have a PHP POP3 app tutorial in their <a href="http://www.devshed.com/Server_Side/PHP">PHP section</a>. HypoMail here we go!</p>
<p>Additional, Slog (this) really needs Hype2 style page breaking technology. Hype2 needs to take some of the massive info-pages of Hype 1 and do the same thing.</p>
