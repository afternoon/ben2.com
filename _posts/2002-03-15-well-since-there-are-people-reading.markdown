<p>Four comments added today, so that&rsquo;s five comments so far. Interesting eh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I haven&rsquo;t posted for a while either, so I will now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been unemployed for about three weeks now. I quit Soup because I had been there for a year and it was starting to be a pain getting up and going in every morning. Annoyingly I am now sleeping too long, but getting out of bed is still too much hassle. Half an hour later it&rsquo;s fine. Ah well.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m now freelance again, with the emphasis definitely on free. Offers of work are coming in (thank you Robert). So in the mean time I&rsquo;m catching up on all the stuff that I never have time to do. So far this has included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working on a C++ version of Hype</li>
<li>Programming a line drawing algorithm in Flash</li>
<li>Programming basic animation in Java (I made a rotating square, it took two days).</li>
<li>Programming a bouncing ball in Flash</li>
<li>A bit of basic OpenGL coding on my Mac</li>
<li>Photoshopping! Yay, haven&rsquo;t done any rasterbating for ages.</li>
<li>Attempting to code the Boid flocking algorithm in Flash</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these have required an amount of revision of various mathematical and programming topics, I&rsquo;ve had to relearn Newtonian physics, vector math and matrix math pretty much from the ground, that&rsquo;s because I never paid any attention in lectures. My C++ and Java were pretty rusty as well.</p>
<p>The flocking looks like it really doesn&rsquo;t want to be coded in Flash, but there you go. I had a look and I could only find one other implementation and it wasn&rsquo;t complete. Then again my version probably won&rsquo;t be either&hellip;</p>
