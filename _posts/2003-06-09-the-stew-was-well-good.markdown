<p>It was the first time I&rsquo;d cooked a stew. It ended up cooking for 3 hours in the end, by far the longest cooking thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. It went really thick in the last half hour and was much better for it, I&rsquo;m sure. The beef was delicious. A slightly different taste from the steak and mince I&rsquo;ve bought before. Ooh, that reminds me, there&rsquo;s a pound and a half of mince in the freezer as well. God bless those organic rearing vertical farmers.</p>
