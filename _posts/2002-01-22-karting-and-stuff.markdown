<p>I went karting for the first time last night. I&rsquo;m not sure if I enjoyed it. I watched Fight Club as well and I&rsquo;m not sure whether I enjoyed that either. I think it was good to do both, I have no regret, but I&rsquo;m not sure whether I would do them again. I&rsquo;m coming round to thinking maybe.</p>
<p>The karting was much more full-on than I expected. Basically I was expecting Wipeout. I got G forces. I was quite nervous as I always am about a thing with a time in the future, unfortunately this didn&rsquo;t go away when I got on to the track. I didn&rsquo;t have the confidence to throw myself into the corners basically. I was braking too much and not accelerating hard enough. Despite this, the whole caning into a corner and be pulled out with so much G was really doing my head in.</p>
<p>I think if it hadn&rsquo;t been a competition I would have loved it, the pressure thing kind of killed it for me. At first I wondered if it was me not just being aggressive enough, but I never went there to win and I certainly didn&rsquo;t go to get injured (I came away with just mild RSI -like arm pain and a bruise). I think the fear of injury, sliding the back end into a wall on a corner and getting whiplash, was basically the reason I did so shit.</p>
<p>Fight club: Hmmm, strange. Modern life is rubbish tale, or was it? What actually happened? Is it just a nice little story about super-wise fat stealing guys? Louise suggested I read the book. I think I will as I&rsquo;m curious to know more. Regards the film I lost concentration near the end, I think they could have cut about ten minutes out before the twist. It was by no means a short  film anyway.</p>
<p>Hmmm</p>
