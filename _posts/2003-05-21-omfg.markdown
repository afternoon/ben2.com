<p>There is a literally gigantic disco funk version of the Spencer Davis Group&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.stevewinwood.com/winwood.Lyrics/ly.imaman.htm">I&rsquo;m a man</a></em>. It&rsquo;s absolutely incredible!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve hooked a rocksteady funk bassline and some 80s synths on to the already fantastic melody. The lyrics are sung by some guy with that quality stunted accent typical of Italo disco. This is one of my favourite tunes anyway. Oh, the ecstasy!</p>
<p>I must have it.</p>
