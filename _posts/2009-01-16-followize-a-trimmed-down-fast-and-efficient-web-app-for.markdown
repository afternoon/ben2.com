<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>View the latest tweet from each person you follow. Get the 1,000 yard view of what your community is talking about.</li>
<li>Clean, minimal, efficient interface.</li>
<li>View replied-to tweets. Just click the name &ldquo;in reply to blah&rdquo; and the original tweet is loaded ajaxily.</li>
<li>View user timelines. The latest tweet is handy for a quick scan, but viewing a twitter&rsquo;s last 10 tweets is as easy as clicking their name.</li>
<li>Links to @replies, #hashtags, $STOCKTWITS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Followize is particularly handy if you follow a bunch of people. Sometimes the more active users drown out the quieter ones. Followize let&rsquo;s you keep up-to-date with everyone easily.</p>
