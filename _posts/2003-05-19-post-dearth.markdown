<p>Nothing to say this week, everything&rsquo;s going pretty well. Last week was fairly hard, the long meeting made me tired and then writing up the proposal afterwards was fairly non-stress-free. However, Louise and I went shopping yesterday and I bought records for the first time in ages. I bought some wicked tunes, but I just want to buy more! I had planned to buy electro in Rough Trade and then go to either Selectadisc or Roughtrade to buy some jungle. Unfortunately I ran out of both money and time and ended up just buying a stack of electro and then the new Four Tet album, which is lovely. I was feeling really good about it and I&rsquo;ve told everyone how happy I am, but then when I tell them what I&rsquo;ve bought they just laugh or make disparaging remarks. Sometimes I love the fact that the music I like is different to what everybody else likes, other times it pisses me off when I&rsquo;ve got no-one to share my triumphs with.</p>
