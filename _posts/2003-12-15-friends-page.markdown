<p>I added a <a href="/friends/">links page</a>. A friend of mine asked me to link to his band&rsquo;s site. I&rsquo;d only been handing out links when people asked for them, not because of any policy, just because I was lazy. Anyway, I ran out of space on the front page, so I had to move them out.</p>
<p>I made the graphics on the page using Proce55ing. The fine art, as <a href="http://aftnn.org/recorder/460">Joshua Davis puts it</a> of &ldquo;waiting to capture that moment in time - the beautiful accident&rdquo;.</p>
