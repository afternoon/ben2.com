<p>It&rsquo;s got a whizzy PHP backend by moi and a whizzy purty front-end by my good friend <a href="http://www.bibbybobby.com">BibbyBobby</a> [warning: no content] and it&rsquo;s cool. Bit of hassle with database servers and slack support staff but <a href="http://www.mhphotographic.co.uk/">it all worked out in the end</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to make a list of the things that had annoyed me during the project and learn from them for the next one, which I have already begun (in fact, I should have already finished it). I&rsquo;ve written a few small classes to abstract things I do a lot. They&rsquo;re not massively general, but they will make my code a lot lighter. I worry too much about run-time, which is really not an issue these days, certainly not for me, and I should be less scared of writing big useful classes.</p>
<p>I have decided to take a week off to work on Hypothetical in March and try to release a new version in time for Hype&rsquo;s second birthday on May 1st. I&rsquo;ve even put milestones in my calendar.</p>
