I&rsquo;m so totally stoked. On Thursday I&rsquo;m going to a new Tai Chi class in Kensington. This one is taught by <a href="http://www.qimagazine.co.uk/setup.htm">Michael Tse</a>. He&rsquo;s the only guy I have been able to find teaching Chen style this side of London and has the added bonus that  he&rsquo;s a student of <a href="http://homepage.tinet.ie/~taijidonegal/page2.htm">Grandmaster Chen Xiao Wang</a>. Xiao Wang is the current heir and head of the style!
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit early to start shouting, as I haven&rsquo;t been yet, but I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to being able to tell people about my place in the Tai Chi lineage :-). I&rsquo;m interested to see how different it is. I did like my old teacher, Kenny, a lot. He was obviously very passionate about Tai Chi and I hope that Michael will be the same. I also hope that there&rsquo;s room for a slacker who doesn&rsquo;t train enough.</p>
<p>Really, I ought to do more training. I never did anywhere near enough outside the weekly sessions at the centre. Oh, that raises another question, should I where my Reyukai Centre (the Norwich centre where I trained) tshirt on Thursday?</p>
