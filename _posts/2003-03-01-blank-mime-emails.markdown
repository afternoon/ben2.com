<p>If you are having problems when generated MIME emails, specifically that the body of the email appears empty even though the required content is patently there, check the line feeds.</p>
<p>Apple Mail allows you to view the source with the control characters displayed which is very useful. I noticed that my blank emails were using \n where lines had been output by qmail and by my own code but \r\n for headers generated by PEAR&rsquo;s Mail_mime class. The first time \r\n was used was in the content type header, specifying the boundary. The boundary wasn&rsquo;t being found and the email was blank.</p>
<p><code>define("MAIL_MIME_CRLF", "\n");</code> was the quick fix. The results work fine in Apple Mail, Eudora, Outlook 2000 and XP, Outlook Express 5 and 6, Hotmail and SquirrelMail.</p>
