<p>I just wrote a Java native function that discovers the MAC address of the first network interface. It wasn&rsquo;t too bad, could have been easier. I would have liked to pass back an array of shorts, but that seemed to cause issues and I already had a working String implementation so I stuck with it. Overall, it was OK, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d like to make too much of a habit of it.</p>
<p>Also we took the Christmas tree down today. We have a big gap in the front room at the moment. However, we&rsquo;re soon going to embark on a huge furniture moving session, which will involve getting rid of the high table and buying a long desk of some kind for Louise and I to share, hopefully solving both our current desk woes.</p>
<p>The little desk I sit at is OK, but it has drawers under the top, these get in the way of my legs and mean I&rsquo;m always stretching wierdly in one way or another. This has lead to some nasty muscle pain at the base of my spine and around my hips recently. The chair I sit on is also becoming increasingly uncomfortable. I spend a lot of time sitting at my desk so it&rsquo;s worth spending some money to make sure the ergonomics are good. At the moment it&rsquo;s a bit of a disaster.</p>
