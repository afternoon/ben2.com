<p>My baby! My baby! I&rsquo;m kind of proud that Hypothetical is still going after a year. I will have been going out with Louise for a year in a couple of days as well, so that&rsquo;s acheivements all round for me. But realistically, the fact that it&rsquo;s been going for a year just serves to highlight how badly it needs rewriting! I&rsquo;m exploring using <a href="http://pear.php.net">PEAR classes</a> to do as much work as possible. I think I will use Smarty to code templates for themes. I recently had good experience writing fog in Perl and using the Template Toolkit module. There are many wheels on the internet, too many to permit reinvention.</p>
