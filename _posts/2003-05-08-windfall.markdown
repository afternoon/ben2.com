<p>My Dad sold his company, the deal is done! I&rsquo;m now the owner of a bunch of shares that are worth a fair amount of money. The only problem is I&rsquo;ve already spent it. It equates very closely to the amount of debt I have, almost to the penny.</p>
<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m torn between clearing out my student loan or instead using the money to travel. The student loan is the cheapest loan I&rsquo;m likely to get so it doesn&rsquo;t make total sense to clear it. However, the amount of money I can gain by selling shares is limited by my liability to capital gains tax. I have an allowance of Â£7900 before I have to pay anything, but this covers my more pressing debts and leaves very little for travel. If I want to have a decent bit of travelling, I will have to either pay a bunch of tax or wait until April next year. Tax will be either 10 or 20%, I can&rsquo;t quite work out which. In addition, I probably won&rsquo;t have to declare the gain until this time next year, meaning I will be liable to pay the tax in 2005. God only knows what my financial situation will be then!</p>
