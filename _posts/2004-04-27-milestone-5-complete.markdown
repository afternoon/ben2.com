<p>Lots of little niceties added to the groups section, a simple but effective files section and the people section is up and running, with picture uploading and everything. All good stuff. I&rsquo;m starting to get to the point where I&rsquo;m finding the odd bug as I test, which is actually a good sign for two reasons: one, finding bugs is better than missing them, they always exist anyway; two, it means that using the site is more complete, the pathways that connect features together are more developed and it&rsquo;s possible to move around the site in a natural manner.</p>
<p>So, on to M6. M6 is a bunch of cake icing really, but core cake icing. Things like portlets for who&rsquo;s online, another theme and a help section. I&rsquo;m hoping that each item in the list should be acheivable in two or three hours. The goal is to have M6 done by the end of this coming weekend so I that I can let some users on to an alpha site with dummy data next week. It&rsquo;s May next weekend. The original Hype was born sometime in May. It is the third birthday soon and I <em>will</em> release a new version to celebrate it. The version I have now is good enough. It&rsquo;s just a case of going the extra few steps to make the experience a bit more enjoyable.</p>
