<p>In January, <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2013/01/pew-internet-research-the-state-of-self-tracking/">Pew Research found that 21% of US adults track some aspect of their health using technology</a>. This is part of a phenomenon called &ldquo;Quantified Self&rdquo; - the measurement of personal behaviours and activities, often using technology such as smartphones and web apps. I&rsquo;m a self-quantifier and have been for a while. Over the years I&rsquo;ve tracked a number of dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Running and training bike rides using <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> and <a href="http://strava.com/">Strava</a></li>
<li>How often I eat meat, do yoga, drink coffee, caffeine or alchohol using <a href="http://chains.cc/">chains.cc</a></li>
<li>Whether I clear out my email inboxes each day</li>
<li>Money (spending, saving, credit card use) using <a href="https://www.anzmoneymanager.com/personal/">ANZ MoneyManager</a> (about the best <a href="http://aftnn.org/2012/oct/04/personal-finance-dashboards-uk-customers/">personal finance dashboard available in the UK</a>)</li>
<li>How many miles I&rsquo;ve cycled (commuting, training and events), using <a href="http://your.flowingdata.com/">your.flowingdata</a></li>
<li>Travel using <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/members/Afternoon">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="https://www.kayak.co.uk/trips">Kayak&rsquo;s My Trips</a></li>
<li>What I eat and the nutritional values of each food using <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Driving Improvements</h2>

<p>I use this data to drive improvements in my life.</p>

<p>For example, if I&rsquo;m training for a race, I check that I&rsquo;m building up my distance at the right rate in preparation. To understand the data, I visualise it using histograms and aggregates statistics. My all time distance on Runkeeper right now is 1,188 KM. I&rsquo;ve only run a few KMs this month, but last month I ran almost 50 KM (I had a big race).</p>

<p>My self-quantification breaks down into two categories: &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;habits.&rdquo; The performance stuff (running and cycling) is a bit vain, but I feel that collecting and visualising performance data has helped me to achieve some big goals, like running a marathon.</p>

<h2>Better Habits</h2>

<p>Measuring some of my habits helps me to make long-term behavioural changes.</p>

<p>Meat-eating is a good example. I love meat, but I like to keep the total amount I consume down. I track whether I ate meat or not each day by ticking a box in <a href="http://chains.cc/">chains.cc</a>. Later I can look back and see easily whether I&rsquo;m sticking to my goal or if I need to work harder. Having aggregate goals like &ldquo;eat meat once per week&rdquo; allows me to indulge when the meat on the table is really good (like when I went to <a href="http://www.auxlyonnais.com/en">Aux Lyonnais</a>) but means that I get the health benefits of a mostly plant-based diet.</p>

<h2>Self-Experiments</h2>

<p>Some self-quantifiers conduct <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/2011/04/how-to-self-experiment/">self-experiments</a> using the data they collect, e.g. &ldquo;does taking drug A make my condition better or worse.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not quite there yet, but it&rsquo;s an interesting direction. I&rsquo;m not sure I have the discipline to collect sufficiently high-quality data.</p>
