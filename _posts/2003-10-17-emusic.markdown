<p>Ah Emusic. Unfortunately they&rsquo;ve realised that their prices are ridiculously low. I mean, $10 a month for as much music as you can download. It&rsquo;s changing to 40 tracks a month at the end of this month. So I&rsquo;m downloading fast.</p>
<p>But the client&rsquo;s being a bastard! I think they must be really heavily loaded by people panic downloading like me. I&rsquo;m getting loads of timeouts and stuff. Worse than that, of 372 tracks downloaded in the past few days, 144 are zero bytes. <em>Even worse</em>, as I listen to tunes I&rsquo;m finding some are just truncated. A nine-minute track that&rsquo;s 700k? I think not. Pain. In. The. Arse.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s the RIAA at work&hellip;</p>
