<p>I&rsquo;m listening to Metallica. It rocks. Quite literally, mate. Two caveats: It&rsquo;s old Metallica (<em>&hellip;And Justice For All</em>) and I stole it off Soulseek. Chortle.</p>
<p>I actually really like that Hetfield guitar sound, which is about the only time I&rsquo;ve admitted to liking anybody&rsquo;s guitar sound, although in reality I guess I actually like quite a few people&rsquo;s guitar sound: Page, Bowie, Santana, Prince, Babe Ruth (as in <em>The Mexican</em> off <em>Dirtchamber Sessions</em>), Ramones of course, Zappa, loads of others.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing the hand sign of the devil <em>a lot</em>.</p>
