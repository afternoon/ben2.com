<p>The big new feature in <a href="http://www.applemusic.com">iTunes 4</a> is Music Store. I&rsquo;ve already read one person who said &ldquo;finally somebody has got it right&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m inclined to agree. You have a bunch of browseable pages leading you to playlists of purchaseable tracks. They look just like other iTunes playlists, you can even double click the tracks to hear a sample. You can access music from any label and you buy songs for 99Â¢. It doesn&rsquo;t work outside the US yet and the selection currently looks bad. I searched for Aphex then Bambaataa and got nothing before giving up and going back to <a href="http://zzzone.net/">the zzzone</a>.</p>
<p>Micropayments. Fantastic. I&rsquo;ve got lots of albums where I&rsquo;m missing a track or two and I&rsquo;ve got lots of artist collections where I&rsquo;m missing the odd release. I&rsquo;ll pay about 60p to get that missing track, oh God I will, I&rsquo;m a major tidier. If you&rsquo;ve heard a DJ drop a tune you really like, why spend weeks waiting for it to arrive on SoulSeek or Kazaa when you can just hit a button and let your card do the talking and not much talking at that? I think this is the next stage for music sales, I think that everybody involved here is going to make money. I&rsquo;m sad that MP3 didn&rsquo;t quite destroy the music industry. Hopefully it will someday.</p>
