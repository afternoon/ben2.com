<p><a href="http://moblog.co.uk">MoblogUK</a> rival TextAmerica will soon stop offering free accounts. Fair enough, but they&rsquo;re also planning to delete photos uploaded by users who won&rsquo;t upgrade to a subscriber account.</p>

<blockquote>Update to the TA Community insiders: Due to the complicated nature of the planned upcoming move to a private paid members only community, changes will not be formally announced until sometime in August. Current &lsquo;free sites&rsquo; will be suspended starting July 1 with a planned deletion scheduled for the fall 2006. DO NOT QUESTION me about these changes as NOTHING will be said in advance of the official notices. THANK YOU for your consideration in this regard.<br/>

<p>I know have a vested interested, but this is a pretty crappy thing to do. Freeze the accounts OK, offer a discount subscription rate maybe, but just killing all the free users off stinks.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re similarly annoyed and a TA user, you might want to consider using our <a href="http://www.firepile.com/software/archives/000797.html">MoblogImporter</a> to move your pictures to <a href="http://moblog.co.uk">MoblogUK</a>. We&rsquo;ll be happy to have you.</p>
