<p>MobileCrunch reports that <a href="http://mobilecrunch.com/2006/04/07/operas-mini-scales-to-profits/">Opera Mini is allowing operators to increase ARPU</a>. Users are downloading the browser in much greater numbers than Opera expected, and they&rsquo;re accessing content outside the walled garden. T-Mobile have seen almost 500% increase in data usage.</p>

<p>Duh!</p>
