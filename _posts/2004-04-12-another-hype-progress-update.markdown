<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not going quite as quickly as I hoped. I was looking forward to having most of it done by now, but the more I do, the more I realise there is to be done.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the core groups functionality, posting features (replying, editing, removing) and personalisation stuff is all there and pretty solid now as well. I was hoping to have the archive up by now, but this has eluded me. That&rsquo;s tomorrow&rsquo;s job. Then after that there&rsquo;s visitors, file uploads, the news system, a set of pages for browsing groups and tools to create and manage them at times other than first login. I&rsquo;d like to do a swishy theme manager, but that can probably wait until a later date. Autolinks-like functionality needs to go in as well, even if it&rsquo;s just adding target=&ldquo;_blank&rdquo; to links for now. Ooh, that can be an option.</p>
<p>So, when I&rsquo;ve done most of the stuff in the list above, I want to go live. Which means shoe-horning the 35,000 messages from the current database into the new schema first. All in, I reckon I have five or six days work left to do at least.</p>
<p>Nuts.</p>
