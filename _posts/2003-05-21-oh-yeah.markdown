<p><strong>I bought a brand new Powerbook!</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the 15&quot;, 1Ghz, 512mb, 60Gb, Airport kind. I stripped out the DVD writer &lsquo;cos it would just sit idle and it&rsquo;s Â£170 that I can spend on beer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fucking elated! A brand sparkly Powerbook, touched by none other, is on it&rsquo;s way straight from Apple. After owning eight computers in my life, this will be the first brand-new boxed one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of stuck what to call it. Diane, the name of my current iBook, came from Twin Peaks. She is Coop&rsquo;s PA, though we never see her and she is only mentioned by Coop as he dictates to her. I thought it was appropriate. After just leafing through a few pages of TP trivia (check out <a href="http://www.twinpeaks.org/">Twin Peaks online</a>), I may opt for Margaret, the Log Lady&rsquo;s real name. If you are unfamiliar with TP, sort it out!</p>
