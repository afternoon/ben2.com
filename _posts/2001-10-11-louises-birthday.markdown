<p>We had big food, fajitas and then choc fondue. Mmm mm good. Lots of people and jolity, nice.</p>
<p>I wrote Louise <a href="http://hypothetical.co.uk/birthdaygirl/">a game</a> as a present. It&rsquo;s just javascript and a bunch of images, but it&rsquo;s neat, I think. I was kind of thinking of trying out tetris. A grid of images in a table would be manipulated by javascript functions, including some use of setInterval. Ah, javascript rules. While writing the game I found that it is possible to attach abritrary members or, presumably, functions to objects. I did it with bog standard images.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about reading up on the DOM, my lax period at work is giving me opportunity to expand and learn. Mac OS X now runs Fireworks and is my primary OS at work now.</p>
<p>Another idea would be to take the foundations in Flake (Flash Snakes) and build that up into something a bit more Alpha Centauri like, isometric terrain, other people etc. Flash could read XML from the server (fed by PHP) - tile data on scroll and then smaller update packets - and maintain a small grid view, perhaps even a map view. It would nice to go this far in javascript, but that would be slow and perhaps straining the point a litte. Ah, tetris though.</p>
<p>Lastly, I inherited a new phone from a guy at work. It&rsquo;s diddy, but has less functionality than my old one. Never mind, it&rsquo;s a novelty for now and I&rsquo;ve got a free upgrade waiting at Orange for when I tire of it.</p>
