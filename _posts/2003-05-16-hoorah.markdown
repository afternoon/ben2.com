<p>I made the DVD player work in stereo and discovered it&rsquo;s actually quite useful for playing CDs now it&rsquo;s plugged into the <em>other</em> amp and the floor-standing Mordaunts. We have no other CD player except computers and, useful though they are, the sound is always going to be a bit crappy.</p>
