<p>Hype 1 has many users who are nobodies, they don&rsquo;t post, they probably don&rsquo;t read, they just don&rsquo;t care [sob]. Anyway, Mat&rsquo;s suggestion: a random bollocks password is created for each user and the account is validated when they login for the first time. Alterations include real user being created when the password is changed. Or: an url is sent out, with some random identifation value, when the url is hit it says &ldquo;user setup complete!&rdquo; and the process creates an entry in users. All that would really be validated by this process would be the email address, which is a bonus, that way any users who aren&rsquo;t serious can still be contacted and proselytised to.</p>
