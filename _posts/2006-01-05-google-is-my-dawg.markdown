<p>F&mdash; me!</p>

<p>Number 1 for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=web+developer+london">web developer london</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="/journal/261/">In April 2003 I was third</a>, rereading my post about that prompted me to try again, smilingly thinking I would be like last or something.</p>

<p>Now that&rsquo;s some good SEO juju. Completely accidental as well. As clearly shown by the fact that I&rsquo;m 10th for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%20london%20+web+developer">london web developer</a>.&rdquo;</p>
