<p><a href="http://www.cybernetic-broadcasting.net/">The Cybernetic Broadcasting System</a> rules! They are currently playing some ultra-dodgy Euro-electro-pop classic with the repeated refrain &ldquo;I want your sexiness!&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
I wake up, I get dressed and you are on my mind!<br/>
I&rsquo;m laughing, I&rsquo;m loosing and you are on my mind!<br/>
When I can&rsquo;t be cool, when I&rsquo;m feeling low<br/>
I want your sexiness!<br/>
When I sing my song and when I look inside,<br/>
I want your sexiness!<br/>
When I touch myself and think of you,<br/>
I want your sexiness!<br/>
<br/>
Every day, all the time,<br/>
I want your sexiness!<br/>
Every day, all the time,<br/>
I want your body now!</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to do a mix of new school electro and lushness for the CBS, but it&rsquo;s never going to beat their collection of eighties monsters.</p>
<p>In other news, I&rsquo;ve been hacking around with DOM 2 functions from HTML. They&rsquo;re neat. I&rsquo;m used to DOM from Java and Flash for XML, but the possibilities are a bit more tangible inside the browser for a lowly web developer. I created a form that constantly reconfigures itself in order to let you specify filters to reduce a list of people to a smaller one, depending on what they&rsquo;ve been up to. You can add new filter lines and configure each one to a reflect simple criterion. It works much like spam filters/classifiers in mail software. DOM 2 seems to be supported pretty well by the current crop of browsers, with the notable exception of IE 5/Mac, which fell on it&rsquo;s face creating form elements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for creating fun pages that just don&rsquo;t stop recombobulating and dance around like ponies on crack. I think I&rsquo;ll leave that for another day though. Special shout goes to <a href="http://www.brainjar.com">BrainJar</a> for being great at teaching things and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> for being the best reference site on the net.</p>
