<p>I have discovered the wonders of <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>, a really very useful piece of software indeed. I wrote a little script to enumerate a folder full of PHP files, discover the class relationships contained within and produce a Graphviz input file. I&rsquo;m going to use it to make a graph of the classes from <a href="http://www.infocms.org/">InfoCMS</a> and release it with the documentation that I&rsquo;m currently writing.</p>
