<p>A friend works at the Telegraph and was foolish enough to turn to me for pithy quotes and hard-hitting telling-it-like-it-is sycophancy about the iPhone this week. You can read his excellent write-up replete with my laser-guided soundbites in his article &ldquo;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2007/01/20/dlmob20.xml">The remote control for your life</a>.&rdquo; How long have I dreamed of becoming a mindless talking head, now I can die happy. Oh wait, TV next.</p>
