<p>I passed my exam! I got 88%, 54 questions right out of 61. I&rsquo;m well chuffed. I had no idea whether I would pass or not right up until when they told me my mark. The test was pretty hard. I had a good twenty minutes at the end to check through my answers and there were a good fifteen that I wasn&rsquo;t confident about. I think I may have been quite lucky in some of my choices.</p>
<p>I got a good breakdown of the test. Threads and garbage collection were my weak points. Especially threads. GC isn&rsquo;t so bad, there were three questions, I got one wrong. Overall, I got 100% in five of the nine areas.</p>
<p>All in all this is my best exam performance since about 1995. I think it may also be the first time I&rsquo;ve revised since then. I did work moderately hard on the revision.</p>
<p>Afterwards I celebrated with a trip to Blackmarket Records and a new Warp t-shirt from Selectadisc. To be honest, that was more my usual pattern of rewarding myself for going to Soho. Used the tube competently again, well done me.</p>
