<p>Another Jake Gylenhaal performance and another really good one, fantastic facial expressions. I really liked this film because it asked questions about time and reality and all that stuff we&rsquo;re used to but not in a science fiction way, but through Donnie&rsquo;s psychological troubles.</p>
<p>Wonderfully, there was almost no ending at all. My flatmate Tom saw similarities between it and Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder, but I&rsquo;m not sure of the value of that comparison. Still, I thought it was really cool.</p>
