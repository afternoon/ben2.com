<p>Brainfuck fucked my brain. It&rsquo;s an interesting language to program in, modeling a very simple computer really, requiring extensive thought about the underlying fabric of my computer. I use <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> a whole lot so I think it&rsquo;s good that I should have to think about how those constructs are implemented at the next level down. Brainfuck provides some of that insight.</p>
<p>The funniest bit was when I went to Dorkbot last night and was trying to tell a guy I met at the Furtherfield party about Brainfuck. He&rsquo;d not heard of it, so I asked another programmer I&rsquo;d met there if he&rsquo;d done any Brainfuck, I said it just as the room went quiet in preparation for the next talk. &ldquo;Yeah mate, I can sort you out some Brainfuck, how much do you need? Yeah wicked mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other than that I&rsquo;ve just been working really. Greg has joined the team and is getting up to speed on much of the stuff that I&rsquo;ve been doing in the last year. That&rsquo;s no mean feat, and at first I overestimated Greg&rsquo;s ability to become productive. That&rsquo;s not a criticism of Greg in any way, I was way off when I thought he would be able to start producing code in the first days. So I&rsquo;ve scaled my expectations back to something approaching normal, giving Greg space to work on a testing system in VB, which he knows, and to become familiar with the new ground.</p>
