<p>Everything seems to be going quite well on the autolinks front. &gt; REWIND &lt; Nothing has broken on autolinks but we need people to actually look at the page before we can really see what&rsquo;s happening. Suggest making a link somewhere. I guess that means getting some kind of SSH client from somewhere and actually editing the page, rather than ignoring it.</p>
