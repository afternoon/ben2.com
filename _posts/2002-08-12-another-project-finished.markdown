<p>The one I alluded to last post, this site is the first one that I have built and designed entirely by myself. It&rsquo;s very minimal and loads ridiculously quickly. It&rsquo;s also all CSS and totally standards compliant. It&rsquo;s only drawback is that it uses the CSS <code>right</code> property, which Netscape 4 doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
