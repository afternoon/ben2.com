<p>By the way, whilst I really like electroclash at the moment, it&rsquo;s all about the music. The antics of Peaches and Casey Spooner, with their five-costume-changes-per-song sex-on-stage pantomine bollocks, are just really annoying IMHO. I know that&rsquo;s a big part of the scene for a lot of people, but I only really like the synths and maybe the attitude of the less well known, less arrogant acts, which is more about making fun records and pretending to be cool like all those eighties stars thought they were. Just as it was back in the eighties, when stars start to think they are actually that cool, they just start being twats.</p>
