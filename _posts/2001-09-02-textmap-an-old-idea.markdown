<p>Everything2 style graph. Ability to add nodes and edges. Should technically be called Textgraph but Textmap is snappier, hehe.</p>

<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="60">nodes:</td>
    <td>id, name, body, author, date</td>
  </tr><tr>
  </tr>
    <td>edges:</td>
    <td>id, key, node</td>
  
</table>

<p>Nodes are the content, edges are the links. Edges automatically detected and inserted into nodes on display.</p>

<p>Difference from everything2 is that there is more than one graph. The point is not to try and link everything together in one mass-mess, but to create interactive text things easily. Example: interactive stories would use highly specific edges (could edge key be a regex? Here is a use for the Data Munging Eugenics system (which needs a recursive acronym). The edges in a documentation textmap would be much more vague.</p>

On reflection, this is just a simplified web, like the www, so I guess it&rsquo;s of limited use.
