<p>Is that real French? Write in and tell me that I suck at French.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote another dandy JS object. This one creates a rollover animation from a series of frames. If you try and do animating rollovers for more than one image with IE (on the Mac, not tested on the PC) when you rollout of one, they all animate. Useless!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m coping slightly better with Jaguar today. To be honest the difference is extremely minimal, but essential in that new toy way. I still don&rsquo;t a working Sendmail, which is a bitch, and the Jaguar-installed copy of Python doesn&rsquo;t want to do xml.dom.minidom properly. Oh well.</p>
