<p>And now here I am, stuck in the wilds of Norfolk. I&rsquo;ve been sequestered to Norwich to work on a project.</p>
<p>I spent all evening drawing a Routemaster bus in Photoshop. I used a image off the web as a template and the final result looks quite good. The problem is it needs to fit into a design somehow and I can&rsquo;t get the other bits right.</p>
<p>I miss Louise, who is bed back in London now. She came up for the weekend, but seems to have left me behind!</p>
