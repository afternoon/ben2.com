<p>Being an entrepreneurial developer has it&rsquo;s upside! I found it! Aside from the obvious, that I haven&rsquo;t found yet (hint exit strategy), you get invited to stuff!</p>
<p>Last night I went to Banner&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.b1.com/insidethebubble/index.php">Inside The Bubble</a> event. Hosted at the Serpentine Gallery&rsquo;s cool bubble pavilion designed by Rem Koolhaas and Cecil Balmond. I ride past this building twice a day and I really want to go inside. It&rsquo;s quite beautifully designed externally, but inside is a bit like a star trek set, plasticy, with cubes to sit on and canapés balanced on stacked translucent plastic rectables, the assembly bearing remarkable to the Tri-D chess from Star Trek.</p>
<p>Once inside, I met Sam Sethi, editor of TechCrunch UK and man about the internet and chatted with him and Simon Grice about MobMart. They were both nice guys and positive about what we&rsquo;re doing. I chatted to another nice guy, Greg Plumbly, and drank some free drinks. But looking around, the whole thing felt wrong. There were canapés, there were free drinks, everyone was wearing suits. We were inside the bubble, it was the hype, I left before the talks started. Reading the site again, it seems the event was a (possibly successful) attempt to position Banner, part of WPP, as the go to people for Web 2.0 marketing. Nice play, but I wasn&rsquo;t the target audience really.</p>
<p>Now I get invited to a wine tasting evening by MobMart&rsquo;s IP lawyers! On a Tuesday night, it&rsquo;s to celebrate the opening of their swanky new offices and the growth of their IP group. I am so there.</p>
