<p>I just replied to www-style quickly explaining my plan, the same content as the previous post but-one really. I got one reply almost straight away:</p>
<blockquote>Just FYI I completely agree with you.  Other than inconsistency across browsers, tables are a great layout mechanism - easy to understand and very powerful.  I think that the CSS designers saw the &ldquo;misuse&rdquo; of tables and threw the baby out with the bathwater.  If you simply renamed the TABLE tag to
LAYOUT, you&rsquo;d have a simpler, more powerful, and more familiar tool than CSS layout and no semantic or accessibility issues.</blockquote>
<p>This expresses something which I agree with but hadn&rsquo;t put down in writing. Sometimes, grids (AKA tables) are a very simple and powerful tool that CSS doesn&rsquo;t provide. The main problem with trying to do things the CSS way is that often the content needs to jostle with other areas to be laid out properly. It&rsquo;s those relationships that absolute positioning can&rsquo;t express, but tables do with ease.</p>
