<p>I wish more of the world understood the actions of Chris Morris. Patrick Marber says that Morris isn&rsquo;t doing it to change anything, which I suspect is probably true, but it would still be nice if more of the world understood. It amazes me that even though people are so jaded by the size of today&rsquo;s world they can&rsquo;t understand that Morris is a <b>satirist</b>.</p>
<p>I guess they are just too wrapped up in the mundanities of day-to-day boredom, money-grabbing and&hellip; OK, I&rsquo;m just going to stop, this is going nowhere.</p>
