<p>Haven&rsquo;t blogged for a while. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to. I&rsquo;ve had a funny week or so.</p>
<p>My Dad was meant to get married for the third time on the 27th of December. He didn&rsquo;t and instead split up with his long-term girlfriend. He&rsquo;s really sad about it, understandably, and I&rsquo;m quite depressed by it too. I don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s happening but she seems to have just given up on their relationship. This may have been going on for ages without me knowing it, I haven&rsquo;t seen her since August, but still, I&rsquo;m sad.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the whole LShift thing. They told me they didn&rsquo;t want to hire me as a developer/designer because they didn&rsquo;t have the role. I wrote back imploring them to consider me as a straight programmer. They agreed yesterday, as long as I produced a whole load of my code for inspection, wrote new answers to a questionnaire gauging my opinions on various programming issues and provided three links for their <a href="http://www.lshift.net/links.html">links page</a>. This was hard. First off my code library is bad, full of little-more-than-started projects and nothing really meaty. Secondly I wasn&rsquo;t sure what was wrong with my first set of questionnaire answers and I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to fix them. Lastly, the page is very much links to programming issue articles. I read this kind of stuff loads but rarely feel strongly enough about a particular issue to have favourite articles about it. I tried to find pieces about stuff I care about, OSS, standards and usability, with a slant towards deploying good software being good for you. I did discover the quite interesting but badly named <a href="http://www.sun.com/developers/evangcentral/">EvangCentral</a> section of Sun&rsquo;s site (BTW I fucking love Sun&rsquo;s redesign, <a href="http://www.useit.com/">Nielsen</a> must be apoplectic with joy). Anyway, the stress levels were high last night, I got into a mental block. I have no idea what the end result will be, I&rsquo;m kind of hoping that they will just turn around and tell me to fuck off, because I&rsquo;ve got the over-riding sensation that I&rsquo;m lying and cheating my way in or at least that I&rsquo;m not really good enough and only narrowly hiding this fact. Even though that may not be true, it&rsquo;s the prevailing mood and is affecting my attitude. If they bring me in for interview I&rsquo;m going to be terrified.</p>
<p>Louise has started her new job. It seems fairly drudgeful, but she doesn&rsquo;t hate it too much. It is not well paid but the company seems to be growing. It was started in 1997 and will make a profit this year. Not bad for an internet company. It&rsquo;s because they have content, you know.</p>
<p>Must go, lots of work to do and a score with younger more successful people to settle. Oh who am I kidding, I&rsquo;m never going to be a superstar developer. I want to be, but I spend my time doing other stuff. Mainly prevaricating. I prevaricate so much that playing on my GameCube is something I &ldquo;keep meaning to get around to,&rdquo; how bad is that!</p>
<p>Plus, I&rsquo;m writing this on Apple&rsquo;s new KHTML-based browser, <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>. It&rsquo;s nice and a bit different from other stuff. It uses the background of the address bar as the loading meter. It at least has nice Aqua form controls!</p>
