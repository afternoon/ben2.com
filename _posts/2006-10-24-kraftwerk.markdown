<p>Rich and I went to see Kraftwerk at I â™¥ Techno this weekend. It was awesome. They had the robots, the glowing grid suits, the german accents, everything. The most impressive thing about their show<sup><a href="#kraftwerk-footnote-1">1</a></sup> I think is the quality of the visuals. They have such a clear brand it&rsquo;s not even true. Each song has a visual theme, often using lyrics displayed in huge pixelated text (by huge I mean like six inches a pixel). I thought it was cool. If you know it and like it too I recommend buying the <cite>Minimum Maximum</cite> box set for some lovely 12&quot; photographs of their shows.</p>

<p>Tonight I was inspired by their set, I created a minimal track in Live. Nothing great, but I just bashed it out, which was fun. Then I wrote a sketch in Processing which draws and animates regular polygons. This was also a lot of fun. I was moderately successful with both projects in a short space of time because I&rsquo;ve invested quite a bit of time thinking about basic music and computer graphics in the past. I have never reached great heights in either field, but I can knock out something basic quite easily now.</p>

<p>The music will need more forming (intro, bridge, etc) before it&rsquo;s suitable to upload, but the sketch is pretty much done. I&rsquo;ll try to put it up sometime tomorrow.</p>
