<p>I&rsquo;ve been slowly reading <em>On Lisp</em> still and probably not picking much of it up because I haven&rsquo;t really been able to think of anything to use as a testbed for code techniques.</p>
<p>I realised this was silly and decided to stay within the bounds of what I know and implement a simple web site engine of some kind, probably towards the CMS end of the spectrum, although we&rsquo;ll see. For now I&rsquo;ve created a teeny weeny script that uses two functions to facilitate the generation of valid CGI output. <a href="/stuff/journal_src/firstcgi.lisp">Check it out</a> (feedback welcome).</p>
<p>I found just writing this taxing enough (it took about three hours to get to that point). I had to learn basic string manipulation and that involved learning how to learn about particular functionality rather than style. <em>On Lisp</em> is aimed more at people who can survive down in the trenches with Lisp already. I found the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">HyperSpec</a> too far in the other direction and there&rsquo;s little in between. Although the <a href="http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/">Common Lisp Cookbook</a> is pretty useful.</p>
