<p>I emailed Underwired to apologise and kind of to test the water. I attached some files that they would need to continue the work without me. Kind of expecting an angry response, I was surprised and saddened when I all got was a single word, &ldquo;thanks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s that working relationship over then.</p>
<p>:-(</p>
