<p>I went along to the Mobile 2.0 drinks and met a good mix of people. Some locals, which means I now have a list of coffee places in Mission to hit. Plus, it was just over 24 hours after I landed that someone said the magic words: &ldquo;So are you going to the Digg party tomorrow?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a party for the election, which kills two birds with one stone. Ideal!</p>
<p>I also met some more industry people. It was especially good to meet the guys from mobile search engine <a href="http://taptu.com/">Taptu</a>. Ironic that we meet here given that they are Cambridge-based. I also met one of Yahoo&rsquo;s mobile team and we exchanged mobile anecdotes.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://barcamp.org/MobileTechForSocialChangeSanFrancisco">Mobile Tech for Social Change</a>. A BarCamp for mobile with a social twist. It is hosted at the Google.org office in SF (not Mountain View sadly, will have to find another way to get down there).</p>
<p>The focus of events has been mobile so far. I&rsquo;m experienced in the sector, but not wedded to it. I&rsquo;m interested to see what&rsquo;s going on, but there is the broader Web 2.0 Summit coming up, with all it&rsquo;s associated aspects. I&rsquo;m looking forward to meeting people there.</p>
