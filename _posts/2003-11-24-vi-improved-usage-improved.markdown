<p>Under urging from <a href="http://assyrian.org.uk/miles/">Miles</a>, I&rsquo;ve put BBEdit in a drawer and gone over to using Vim as my main editor. I&rsquo;ve been using Vim for a while now, but I&rsquo;m not proficient enough with it to use it as fluidly as I use BB.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to learn a bit more now though. I&rsquo;m kind of trying to resist buying a book. I don&rsquo;t really get along with the interactive help.</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing I found out from the newbiedoc project, was <a href="http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/tutorials/vim/mapping-vim.html.en">how to set up macros</a>, particularly insert-mode macros:</p>
<p class="eg"><code>imap &lt;h1 &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;<esc>2ba</esc></code></p>
<p>This macro types &ldquo;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&rdquo;, positions the cursor between the two tags and goes into insert mode. Useful. There&rsquo;s a lot more you can do, Vim supports functions as well, so I&rsquo;ll have to get into those. I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to do the kind of things that you can do with the Perl regex pattern modifier <code>e</code>. That would be handy. I really need to conquer Vim&rsquo;s regex syntax, I keep tripping up at the moment.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m reading Bram Moolenaar&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits_paper.pdf">Seven habits of effective text editing</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty damn informative.</p>
