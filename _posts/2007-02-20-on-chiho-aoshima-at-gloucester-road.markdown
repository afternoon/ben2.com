<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiho_Aoshima">Chiho Aoshima</a> exhibition at Gloucester Road is the highlight of my daily commute. Sometimes during that commute my city way of life seems to be madness, but Aoshima always makes me think of the opportunities for warmth, happiness and friendship here, as much as the fresh air and new life to be found in the country. My girlfriend currently lives in Mexico and the range from country to city parallels the distance between us, but also makes me feel like it&rsquo;s not that far. Japanese characters like these have childlike joy in spades, and that&rsquo;s not so far from how our relationship works either.</p>
