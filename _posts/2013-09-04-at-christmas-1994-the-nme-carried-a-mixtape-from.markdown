  At Christmas 1994 the NME carried a mixtape from the Chemical Brothers (still known as the Dust Brothers at that point). I lost my copy ages ago, but it was probably warped to shit from all the times I played it. This track was the highlight. I don’t think I’ve heard it since then. It’s insane to think that was almost 20 years ago. O.M.G. I’m practically dead now.

  Edit: Lo and behold, somebody’s kindly posted the entire NME Xmas Dust Up mixtape to Mixcloud. Enjoy!
