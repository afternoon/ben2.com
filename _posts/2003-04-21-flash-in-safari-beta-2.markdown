<p>I&rsquo;ve just added a few more animating features to the front page Flash movie and as I was checking it I noticed that there was a noticeable difference in speed when running it under Safari against running it in the Flash IDE. On checking my old stuff as well, it looks like Apple has seriously improved Flash performance in this release. This is a Very Good Thing. Mac Flash performance has always been crap, particularly considering that a large proportion of quality Flash is built on Macs.</p>
