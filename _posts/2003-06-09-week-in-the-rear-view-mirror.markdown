<p>Stuff&rsquo;s been going on, I just haven&rsquo;t been blogging.</p>
<p>I spent 35 hours on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday writing a specification. It came to 30+ pages. At one point it had me totally curled up with stress. Louise gave me <a href="http://www.bachcentre.com/centre/38/rescue.htm">Bach&rsquo;s Rescue Remedy</a>, which managed to unknot me enough so that I could finish.</p>
<p>The Powerbook was nearly delivered on Thursday, but they  couldn&rsquo;t get in. The removal of the sticky may have been to blame. Grrr. I could have gone and got it yesterday morning, but nobody answered the phone and I didn&rsquo;t know the address. It will come tomorrow. Joy.</p>
<p>Instead, Louise and I went to a farmer&rsquo;s market in a car park in Notting Hill. It was pretty cool. All the food looked great and everybody was really friendly. We bought a bunch of stuff, including goose eggs, which were immense. I bought some braising steak, which I&rsquo;m currently stewing. Man, it smells fantastic. I bought some black radishes which are going in as well. There&rsquo;s also some potatoes, carrots, shallots and some of the Thyme I&rsquo;ve been growing in there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve chilled a lot this weekend. I really wanted to kick back. I&rsquo;ve got to do some work now, but that&rsquo;s OK. I read the last issue of <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/">Wired</a> which contains some really interesting stuff about concepts of space: network space, dump space, blog space, sex space, 30 spaces in total.</p>
<p>Also, Louise and I went to Kensington today and looked at furniture in a wonderfully couply way (2 years and counting :-). I saw a cool soft cube for Â£30 that I could sit on the balcony on. Also, desk bits in Habitat. I&rsquo;m thinking of building a desk out of some leg bits and a chunk of glass. I want to move into the front room because at the moment I sit in a hall with no windows, whilst the sun shines in the next room. Plus I sit in a different room from my speakers. Ack! Anyway, a plan is germinating.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, last night I saw Seven for the first time! Sorry everyone. I won&rsquo;t do a review, &lsquo;cos everybody&rsquo;s seen it. Suffice to say I really enjoyed it.</p>
