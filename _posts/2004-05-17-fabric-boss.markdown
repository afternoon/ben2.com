<p>Went to Fabric on Friday. It was wicked! Definitely the best club I&rsquo;ve been to. The club building itself is sweet, set in a big old cellar complex beneath Farringdon. It bears great similarity to a Quake level, especially being lit in primary colours. The rooms are big, but not ridiculous. The sound system was very good as well, actual treble! Did hurt my ears quite badly, but they&rsquo;re back to working order now.</p>
<p>Woke up very broken yesterday and even more today. Lots of muscles strained in my arms and back. I did really enjoy the dancing, but next time I think I&rsquo;ll have to limber up!</p>
<p>I even took some <a href="http://moblg.net/view.php?id=7754">pictures</a> and put them on my Moblg.</p>
