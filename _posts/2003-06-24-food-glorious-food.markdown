<p>We resumed Dinner and a Movie night at Superflat. Whereby we invite Charlie over and cook food and, um, watch a film. Last night we were going to watch Amores Perros but it didn&rsquo;t happen in the end. Instead Charlies gave me pointers on managing my portfolio (now almost completely sold) and we watched a bit of James Bond.</p>
<p>Dinner was good though. We started with some soda bread that Louise bought at the farmer&rsquo;s market yesterday, it had the most ludicrously crunchy crust. For second course Louise had fish cakes also from the market. I cooked a Soy beef stir fry with egg noodles for Tom, Charlie and I. I actually managed to marinade the beef overnight which was nice, it was very tendy and very salty by the time we ate it. The stir fry ended up a bit of a mish mash again. I think that basically our hob is not hot enough to fry things quickly enough. Oh well. For desert Louise made meringues. They were lovely. They were fantastically sweet. We had them with whipped cream and raspberries. I killed the cream a bit by over-whipping it, but it was OK.</p>
