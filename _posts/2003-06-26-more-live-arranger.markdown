<p>Not only can I position tracks in the Cubase style. You can also position sounds at some ridiculous resolution. I have no idea how close they are, suffice to say that when I positioned 8 beats in row it sounded more like a fart than a bassline. That&rsquo;s what I call Squarepusher accuracy. I can now compose really complicated breakbeats and melodies and, more importantly, tweak them on the fly.</p>
