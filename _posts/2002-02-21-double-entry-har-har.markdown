<p>Is this caused, in the main, by a page requested by a Location header not turning up in time and people freaking and re-clicking the button? If so then maybe some kind of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, your message has been uploaded&rdquo; HTML along with the Location header would be better. The v2 style delete buttons will help.</p>
<p>A propreitary template language is blantantly a much better idea as the full weight of PHP functionality is to much. What is useful though is simple logic. Being able to selectively dump sections based on NS or IE and page ID and that kind of stuff would still be good. Also QuickPlace&rsquo;s ReplaceString attribute just rules sometimes, some kind of regex business would be cool perhaps.</p>
<p>Valid XHTML? CSS? It&rsquo;s the trend, so rock it. Because of browser magic it could be dropped to HTML or WML when required.</p>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t help thinking that XML could play some kind of role in the production of Hype&hellip;</p>
