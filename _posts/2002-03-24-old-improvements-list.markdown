<p>This list had been on Hypothetical since the beginning. Since I stopped altering the code about six months ago, I thought it should finally go&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>uploading files &gt; 64k</li>
<li>javascript html writer for editing posts</li>
<li>proper portlet structure, currently it&rsquo;s all static, but modularisation must happen soon</li>
<li>more theme control, theme creation forms (offline content creation)</li>
<li>facilities to attach files to categories dynamically.</li>
<li>page creation forms</li>
<li>more advanced content contribution - detail pages, generalised folder pages, attempt to provide tools for building microsites offline and then posting them without FTP</li>
<li>more mail bizniss, will feature: POP3 account checking, address books (xml export!), more&hellip;</li>
</ul>
