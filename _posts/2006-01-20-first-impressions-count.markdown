<p><a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/blink/">First Impressions Count in Website Design</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Web designers have as little as 50 milliseconds to capture the interest of potential customers. Through the halo effect, first impressions can influence subsequent judgments of website credibility and buying decisions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;[&hellip;] that feeling you evoke in users through a &quot;clean, professional design&rdquo; can have a halo effect on their buying judgments.&ldquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>If you operate a website for profit, invest in design! Without it you&rsquo;re really on to a non-starter. A badly designed, confusing page is the equivalent of turning up late to meetings and not looking the part (and this from someone who has to fight hard not to do both at every meeting). Except of course, that while you can fit in a few meetings a week, your homepage can be shipped to hundreds, thousands, millions of visitors.</p>
