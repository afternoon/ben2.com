<p>If you get links that don&rsquo;t work in Apple Mail it may be because you&rsquo;ve put align=&ldquo;left&rdquo; on the table tag.</p>
<p>Oh god, HTML email is all good but it does mean that I have to go through a slew of new and fairly crappy  rendering enginesto make sure that they can all handle what I&rsquo;m sending them. I&rsquo;m surprised by the low quality of a lot of the products. Particuarly Apple Mail actually, which does not understand a line of CSS. I hope this situation will change with the whole Safari thing.</p>
<p>By the way, the reason for this and the last post is that I&rsquo;m developing a direct mail application. It&rsquo;s nearly 5,000 lines of PHP now and has taken me about 110 hours of coding time to produce. It currently lacks a realistic interface (it looks very much like the database it&rsquo;s built around) but it&rsquo;s functionally pretty much there. It will be managed and so should be able to compete with the big boys and undercut them quite a bit.</p>
