<p>I found a bag for my Powerbook. This is a tricky decision. Laptop bags are always really ugly, far too big and obviously laptop bags.</p>
<p>I carry my iBook in an <a href="http://www.drbott.com/prod/db.lasso?code=5811-IBSP">IceBook Sleeve</a>, which I&rsquo;m very happy with. I&rsquo;m using it as a selling point when touting the machine around. The nice thing is that it&rsquo;s custom made for the 12&quot; iBook. The computer sits snugly and the accessories pocket is full but never bursting. The only problem I have with it is that it&rsquo;s not big enough for documents or magazines, but this is due to the size of the iBook itself and shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue with the Powerbook.</p>
<p>My new bag will be an <a href="http://www.acmemade.com/bags.html">Acme Made Slim</a>. The basic ones come in at about Â£65 including shipping from the US. Not too bad. I&rsquo;m tempted by the designer ones, but they&rsquo;re another $40 and not <em>that</em> great. The Slim has lots of foam, some high impact plastic and is water-resistant, which is particularly important since I&rsquo;ve been more worried by rain than bashing and banging during my time with the IceBook. The Slim doesn&rsquo;t have a specific document pocket, but hey, I&rsquo;m not supposed to be carrying paper, this is the 21st century. As long as I can fit a copy of Wired or Edge in there somewhere and perhaps an A4 pad once in a while, I&rsquo;ll be happy.</p>
