<p>Doing some research whilst writing the business plan for my <a href="http://moblogtech.co.uk/">latest venture</a>, I dug up a few bits about the business models in blogging:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/archives/2005/05/13/blogging_business_models.php">Publishers create lies that appeal to their audiences, while bloggers write lies that appeal to themselves</a>.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2005/06/blogs_on_ice_si.html">Blogging at Ice.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.weblogsinc.com/">Weblogs Inc</a>&rsquo;s model is to run a bunch of blogs, including <a href="http://www.engadget.com/">Engadget</a>, simply to make money. The blog content drives traffic through their ads and that&rsquo;s a business. All they have to worry about is hiring writers who create interesting blogs.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2004/nf20041111_5342_db035.htm">It&rsquo;s a gold rush, sell shovels</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And an interesting aside: <a href="http://www.corante.com/mooreslore/archives/2005/09/09/murdochs_internet_strategy.php#more">Murdoch&rsquo;s internet strategy is to capture kids</a>. We hope to explore whether moblogging will take off in the yoof market. Must think of a good model for my plan.</p>
