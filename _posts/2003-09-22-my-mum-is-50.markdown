<p>We spent the weekend celebrating by having a big meal and hanging out a bit. Kate cooked a chocolate meringue opus and today Louise used the plums from last weekend to make jam. Lots of jam.</p>
<p>Mmmm.</p>
<p>On Friday we saw <em>Spirited Away</em>, the new Miyazaki film. It was excellent, full of magic. The main character was engaging, despite being a child. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I preferred Princess Mononoke, which was a bit more involved plotwise, but I really want to see <em>Spirited</em> again.</p>
<p>Now I have a bug list that needs to have no P1 bugs on it by tommorrow, but currently has about 10 on it.</p>
