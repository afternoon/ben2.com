<p>I made Toad in the hole! This is the first time I&rsquo;ve made batter. Hell, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve used flour as an ingredient. I started late so it didn&rsquo;t really have time to cook all the way through. It was a bit eggy still at the bottom, but it was perfectly edible. More the batter equivalent of al dente than undercooked.</p>
<p>The batter had Thyme, the sausages Rosemary. It was quite  a herby number. It was fit and most filling. Mmmm, good.</p>
