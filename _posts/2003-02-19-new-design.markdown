<p>Finally! A new design for this page. Sorry that the page has been so ugly in the interim. I like the new design, but it&rsquo;s not finished. I&rsquo;ve rushed it today and it&rsquo;s not quite what I saw in my head originally.</p>
<p>I hope to bring in more elements and make the left-hand graphic less abstract. It also currently frames the text in a way that I don&rsquo;t really like, so I&rsquo;m going to try and break that hard line up a bit. Perhaps that graphic would be more suited to the bottom of the page? Anyway, we&rsquo;ll see how much Illustrator time there is to be had this week.</p>
