<p>I made a <a href="/stuff/music/afternoon-hurry.mp3/">track</a> a long time ago and when I came to build this site I decided to upload it.</p>
<p>A few days ago <a href="http://starant.com/">Drew</a> emailed me to ask if it was OK to use the track for a recording of a series of interviews. I said yeah! The interviews focus on the relationship between image and text and are very interesting.</p>
<p>So sharing leads to great content for everyone. This makes me happy. I feel like I&rsquo;ve given something - however small - back to the net for once.</p>
