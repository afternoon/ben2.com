<p>I talked to my client about his design. He gave me reasons for keeping frames and we had a fairly spirited discussion about it. I&rsquo;m still implementing the same project, but it&rsquo;s OK now because I&rsquo;m reassured that he didn&rsquo;t just make things up and back up his decisions. Also a working demo is more urgent than I had understood, changing the goals slightly.</p>
