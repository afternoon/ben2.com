<p>I&rsquo;ve switched my RSS feed over to Feedburner. Feedburner offers a whole slew of great tools for publishers, analysis tools like readership and click-throughs, automatic splicing in of other content, like links posted to <a href="http://del.icio.us/afternoon/">my del.icio.us account</a>, smart reformatting of feeds for different user agents, up to promotional kit like pinging Technorati et al every time I update. Basically it&rsquo;s a feed swiss army knife, I&rsquo;m very impressed (if a little behind the crowd).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be making a few other changes to the site over the next month or so as well, and although the old feed will keep working, I&rsquo;m going to be promoting the Feedburned feed only.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this through the feed, please update your bookmarks to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/afternoon">http://feeds.feedburner.com/afternoon</a> (yes, I would like to issue a permanent redirect header on the original url too, but then where would Feedburner get it&rsquo;s data from?).</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
