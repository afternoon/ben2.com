<p>Turns on ftplugins! Took me ages to work out why they just weren&rsquo;t getting read. That&rsquo;s much better than setting up loads of autocommands. Just have one which sources a file once per buffer, rather than on every BufRead.</p>
<p>I also set up some Mac-like motion key commands, like Apple-right and such, so they behave as they do in standard OS X text controls. This will make it a lot easier for me to make the transition.</p>
