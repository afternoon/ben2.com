<p>Dear [Afternoon]</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your recent letter to me with regard to your concerns about the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce some form of ID card system in the UK in the future.</p>

<p>May I first of all apologise for the delay in my response to you but this is due to a heavy caseload coupled with the seasonal holidays.</p>

<p>I very much share your concerns and scepticism about the likely efficacy of such a system and would advise you that at the current time if this matter comes before the House of Commons I think that it would be extremely unlikely that I would support it.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss this mater [sic] in more detail could I suggest that you contact my office and we can arrange a mutually convenient time to meet.</p>

<p>Thank you once again for taking the time to write to me and I look forward to meeting with you in the very near future.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Iain Coleman MP<br/>
Hammersmith and Fulham</p>
