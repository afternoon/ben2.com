<p>Every couple of months I hear a tune that I become obsessed with. I play it many times a day for a few days. Normally it&rsquo;s some crunchy electronics with a synth hook that just catches me emotionally for some reason (e.g. Plaid&rsquo;s <em>Bo Bootch</em> or Aphex&rsquo;s <em>Laughable Butane Bob</em>). This time it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.iuma.com/IUMA/Bands/DOKAKA/">Dokaka</a>&rsquo;s cover of Metallica&rsquo;s <em>Creeping Death</em>.</p>
<p>Why is this insane? Dokaka are an Otaku A Cappella act. One guy, he covers tracks by paintakingly imitating each instrument layer of the original track and mixing the lot together to form a really dense but highly nonsensical sound. It&rsquo;s utterly compelling though.</p>
