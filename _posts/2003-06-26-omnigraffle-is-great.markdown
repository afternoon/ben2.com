<p>I used it before and for some reason didn&rsquo;t take to it. When I bought my Powerbook I got a copy free. Now I&rsquo;m using to make process diagrams and I&rsquo;m wondering how I ever made sitemaps or anything else without it. Omni are a cool company. OmniWeb is a touch useless and may well die now Safari&rsquo;s about, but everything else of there&rsquo;s is pretty cool. I&rsquo;ve got OmniOutliner as well which looks useful. However, I&rsquo;m already using the almost identical functionality in NetNewsWire so I&rsquo;m not sure how much use Outliner will get. NNW is not free though and I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll buy it. I&rsquo;ve given up using it to track BBC News and the Guardian and stuff, too distracting. I now use it to monitor the sites that update fairly infrequently but that I like to keep tabs on. Sites like <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">Kuro5hin</a> and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman&rsquo;s Daily Report</a>. I&rsquo;d love to use it to track the blogs of my friends, but none of them have RSS power. Honestly. ;-)</p>
