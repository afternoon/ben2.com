<p>Well, today was a manic day! After trying to sort everything out during office hours, I spent about two hours just cruising around Norwich in traffic, picking up, buying and setting down. After all that calmed down we got the van and got on with the heavy lifting, my the heavy lifting! After about five hours of solid packing the van was full to three feet with a wardrobe (light, wooden) on top. We finished in time for me to nip to the pub with the City Road and Thickthorn gangs, but Louise continued packing.</p>
<p>After the pub we had our last mini-after-party, the room was hot despite the fact that I was still loading the van and had the front door open. As that died we bid each person goodbye, lots of hugs. Martin, our recruited driver/overseer took the van back to Thickthorn â€” we didn&rsquo;t want to leave our entire worldly possesions outside City Road! I wonder how the tightly packed stuff performed on the way over. We may well make adjustments in the morning&hellip;</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m off to have my last shower. We&rsquo;ll be up at the crack of hell to get going. We aim to set off from Thickthorn by ten, which means up at eight thirty. I haven&rsquo;t got up in the AM for about three months!</p>
<p>So tomorrow we will finally get to see whether we can get everything in the house and if we&rsquo;ve made a terrible mistake or not! The excitement begins here!</p>
<p>Oh, and goodbye to everybody that I haven&rsquo;t yet said goodbye to, especially Greg, I missed you tonight and I&rsquo;m sorry I forgot to drag you out. I&rsquo;ll see you all soon everyone.</p>
