<p>Remember when I said I&rsquo;d used a hack for the first time? That same stylesheet now has four different versions of one property, each using a different hack to single out IE 5 PC, IE 5 Mac, IE 6 PC and compliant browsers like Moz and Safari! There are some others where two values are used, one for IE 5 and one for the rest. The document is still fully valid CSS though.</p>
<p>My copy of the <a href="http://designofsites.com/">Design of Sites</a> arrived today as well.</p>
