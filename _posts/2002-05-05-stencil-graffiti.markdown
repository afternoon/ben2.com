<p>Did my first bit of stencil graffiti today:</p>

<p>Worked OK. The stencil was a bit small, and I sprayed too close so it ended up dripping. However, next time I won&rsquo;t make that mistake. Bigger bit of card, with lots of space for holding. Then spray from a distance of at least six inches with a sweeping motion. You have to get good coverage without getting too much paint in one place.</p>
<p>There you go, I&rsquo;m a fucking expert right now.</p>
