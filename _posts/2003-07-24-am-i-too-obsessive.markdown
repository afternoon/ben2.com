<p>I&rsquo;m working hard to finish wwWebflow 2 for next week. Funny thing, I just changed the capitalisation of some file names, remove some capitals, went for the javaStyleOfCapping. Now the interface feels faster and less clunky, simply because I place such a high value on neatness. Am I insane?</p>
