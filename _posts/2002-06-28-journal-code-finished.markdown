<p>I have thrashed the journal code into a state I&rsquo;ve decided to refer to as finished. I have added <a href="/journal/search/">searching</a> and a whole new navigation system. Searching was pretty easy with MySQL&rsquo;s fulltext indexing, you can search in a specific mood as well. The new nav pulls the links out of the stream of text making them a bit more noticeable and it looks nice over there on the right.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mat for testing and feedback, I&rsquo;ve now polished off the rough edges he noticed. On the off chance that anybody notices any more &ldquo;unexpected features&rdquo; please drop me an email. All addresses on this domain forward to me so pick any address you like at aftnn.org. Thanks!</p>
