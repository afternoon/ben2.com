<p>Well, 95% complete. The first users have their accounts and will be looking around the site tomorrow. Arena4 is a learning community product that I have been working on. I was asked to redesign the user interface in October. The product was working but needed to be rebuilt from a usability and design perspective. A task I have now pretty much completed.</p>
<p>The project has been quite a big one and hard as I haven&rsquo;t been paid cash. I am a shareholder in the company as this is a new venture. I&rsquo;m happy with that, even though my finances have come close to the wire on several occasions. Today is a case in point, my rent went out successfully, but I only have Â£12 left in my account!</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m very chuffed with the product. Only now am I starting to be able to move naturally around the site and use it. As I do, I swell with pride. As a budding usability professional one of my key concerns is that unless you use a product, you can&rsquo;t really know its faults and advantages. I feel that I need to use Arena4 more really, but it seems to work OK despite being designed kind of as individual chunks. I may ask Mat, another budding usability professional and a close friend, to review it for me. See what he comes up with.</p>
<p>From here it really starts to get interesting, to see what the users do with our baby. Which bits will baffle, which save time? Will they use things as I designed them to be used or will they rebel against the structure and revert to email? That&rsquo;s the worst-case scenario. Sadly, if that happens it will most likely be because they can&rsquo;t gain value from the product rather than due to interface incongruities, which would mean we have really failed. We&rsquo;re planning to do a round of questionnaires in a couple of weeks, guage the response from the group.</p>
