<p>I totally forgot to write about Louise&rsquo;s birthday - don&rsquo;t take that to heart Louise! We had a really nice day. I bought her a pretty big bouquet of roses and thistles. They were very pretty and the whole thing was lovely. It was the first time I&rsquo;d bought flowers and also the first time Louise had been bought flowers.</p>
<p>I went to a nice looking shop on Munster Road and confessed my ignorance and bought the flowers. When I went back to collect them I got to watch the guy making the bouquet, which was pretty good.</p>
<p>The reason I mention this is that they&rsquo;re just starting to drop. A week is a pretty good innings. The thistles will keep going for a while yet.</p>
<p>The rest of Louise&rsquo;s birthday was cool too, we went for a meal at the <a href="http://www.conran-restaurants.co.uk/restaurants/restaurants/chophouse/info.html">Chop House</a>. It was nice because lots of people came. I got us a bit lost though, assuming that Bermondsey tube would be nearer to the restaurant than London Bridge and being very wrong. Louise wasn&rsquo;t overly impressed.</p>
<p>After the meal we went to see David Blaine. We had nothing to throw and the whole thing was pretty dull really. We left quickly and sat in the flat while Miles drank port and Adam had rum. I tried to motivate people towards poker, but it was late.</p>
