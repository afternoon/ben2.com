<p>I&rsquo;m an independent software engineer working on a contract basis. I have a process for projects. It&rsquo;s a relatively lightweight, loosely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile</a> methodology. It attempts to ensure projects run smoothly by building software in a series of short iterations.</p>

<h2>Face-to-face or Skype meeting</h2>

<p>After an introduction is made, I organise a face-to-face or Skype meeting. I get an overview of the requirements and the context in which the application will sit, the business goals. Clients often have preconceptions about what I&rsquo;ll do, how long it will take, etc. I like to learn about the project so I can challenge those preconceptions if necessary. For example, if a client asks me to create a blogging tool, I&rsquo;ll make sure that none of the off-the-shelf tools will do before proceeding. I&rsquo;m actually pretty vigorous in recommending alternate approaches. <a href="http://aftnn.org/2009/may/19/software-development-advice-startups/">My experience is that a lot of stress and heartache can be avoided</a>.</p>

<p>Because I practise agile software development, I encourage clients to find a minimum set of features which can be implemented an iteration lasting up to 2 weeks. This is a useful process. It encourages both me and my clients to think about the business goals first. If those goals can be met without software or with off-the-shelf tools, we can make that decision now.</p>

<h2>Specification document</h2>

<p>After the initial meeting and a follow-up email or 2, I will produce an iteration specification document. I usually get this to the client within a few days to a week depending on how busy I am. I can rush it through if necessary.</p>

<p>The specification will list the set of user stories (how the app will be used, tasks it will support) and the features required (the actual stuff I&rsquo;ll build). The feature set will take no more than 2 weeks to develop, test and deploy. Additional features are left for subsequent iterations.</p>

<p>If the client is happy, work begins. Otherwise the spec is revised. The spec is my statement of intention, this is my understanding of what the client wants me to build. I ask my clients to check this carefully. If I&rsquo;ve got something wrong, it&rsquo;s time-consuming to fix later. It&rsquo;s often hard to make spec docs exhaustive and unambiguous and this can lead to disagreements, I try hard to avoid that.</p>

<h2>Developing iteratively</h2>

<p>The work begins on the first iteration. I will develop the required features and test and deploy the software within the stated time period. During this period communication slows down a bit. Coding requires a really quite extreme level of concentration so I tend to close my email, Skype, etc and put my headphones on.</p>

<p>Only quite minor changes to the spec can be accommodated once an iteration has begun. If changes are frequent, it&rsquo;s very hard to get up to speed. A car can go much faster on a straight road. The client&rsquo;s desire to provide new feedback and ideas and the developer&rsquo;s desire to get the job done are often in competition. The beauty of developing in short iterations is that this competition can be resolved. Ideas can wait a week or 2, in fact they benefit from more consideration, meanwhile the develop can code away undisturbed.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the iteration, the new code is deployed to somewhere where it can be tested by myself, the client and other stakeholders, often a staging site. Bugs are found and fixed. Loose ends are tied up. Finally, the software is put into production. Bug testing and fixing takes from 25-50% of the iteration time. Deployment is generally straightforward, but can still take a few hours, for that reason it&rsquo;s only done once per iteration.</p>

<p>When an iteration is complete, the process begins again. A face-to-face or Skype meeting allows the client and I to assess what&rsquo;s been achieved so far. Learning from one iteration goes into the next. A new spec is produced and I get back to work.</p>
