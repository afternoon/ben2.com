<p>Wow, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> has really landed. It seems every blog I&rsquo;ve visited this week has a GA post at the top, and I&rsquo;ve visited a lot of diverse blogs in the last week. Is this web analytics coming of age? It blows every other free solution out of the water completely, that&rsquo;s for sure, so a lot more people are going to start tracking a lot more stuff. Damn, maybe even I&rsquo;ll use it :-).</p>
