<p>I sat down to get some serious work done this evening, but the Linux box hosting the application I want to work on died for no reason. One minute it booted fine, the next it wouldn&rsquo;t respond to SSH. I rebooted a few times but nothing came back. I plugged it into a monitor and it seems to have decided that it doesn&rsquo;t want to mount it&rsquo;s /proc. A sure sign of total fucking disaster. The partition is XFS, but <code>xfs_repair</code> produced only a screenful of text and certainly no results.</p>
<p>This is all very fucking irritating. My client will be most pissed off at this and I will have to go over to them to get a new box or to get this one fixed. I&rsquo;ll lose at least a day and a half over this shite when I&rsquo;ve got a million better things to be doing. I really wanted to get stuff moving today and I&rsquo;ve been totally frustrated in the desire to get some ticks next to things on my todo list.</p>
<p>I reckon it&rsquo;s a disk problem. I suspect the box has been thrown around by a courier a bit too much, so my vitriol is reserved for him I think. Utter utter bastard that he is. Probably.</p>
