<p>Read a <a href="http://www.php.net/zend-engine-2.php">brief intro to PHP 5</a> today. Looks good. Passing by reference by default, exceptions and dereferencing objects returned from functions (leading to Java-style getThing()-&gt;getSubThing-&gt;makeStuff() chaining), amongst other good stuff. Found a <a href="http://www.theopenenterprise.com/story/TOE20021204S0001">moderately interesting article</a> about it&rsquo;s potential as well.</p>
