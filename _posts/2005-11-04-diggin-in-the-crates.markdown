<p>Spent a bit of time re-organising my Documents folder. This folder has been growing new content since 1995. So sorting it out was much like going into the shed you haven&rsquo;t opened the door of for a year or two. Ultimate spring cleaning.</p>

<p>I found a whole bunch of HTML stuff I did whilst at college and uni, not just web dev, but writing, graphics, everything. Some of the UEA crew may remember Marionville :-). In many ways this site today is just the latest part of an evolving low level creativity that I&rsquo;ve been indulging since I wasn&rsquo;t a kid anymore. It&rsquo;s wierd looking back at the old stuff and seeing clear threads that lead into who I am today. Embarrasing as it is, I would like to put some of it live. I&rsquo;ve been thinking this site needs a redesign as it goes, but I&rsquo;ve just been soo busy with Cohack, Moblog, freelance, Resident Evil, Live-rockin&rsquo; and everything else I&rsquo;ve kind of run out of time to just piss about. Which is a real shame.</p>

<p>Early new year&rsquo;s resolution: get back on the random acts of creativity tip.</p>

<p>Plus, I&rsquo;ve been blogging for 4.5 years! If only I blogged a bit more, that might be interesting :-).</p>
