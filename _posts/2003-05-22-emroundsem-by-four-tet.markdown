<p>Four Tet are the kings of laptop folk rock. Their music carries on where the melancholic prepared pianos of <em>Drukqs</em> leave off. Music constructed from fragile instrumentation which I find strangely remisnicent of outlying places, like the Scottish Isles or the Newfoundland of E. Annie Proulx&rsquo;s <em>The Shipping News</em> (the book, not the film).</p>
<p>The new album, <em>Rounds</em>, seems initially to retreat towards heavy hip hop beats. The soul is all still there though. The fifth track on my copy, <em>Spirit Fingers</em>, in particular, is no less tear-jerkingly lovely than anything else they&rsquo;ve done. I&rsquo;m a bit sad not to see tracks that combine rockin&rsquo; and loveliness as deftly as my favourite of their oeuvre, <em>Everything Is All Right</em>, although <em>As Serious As Your Life</em> has a go. As with Photek&rsquo;s <em>Ni Ten Ichi Ryu</em>, I suspect <em>Everything Is All Right</em> just serves as a window on to what they listen to in heaven.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure though, I&rsquo;m on my fourth listen and it&rsquo;s growing, growing fast.</p>
