<p>You can&rsquo;t connect one of the new 12&quot; Powerbooks to the cinema displays. Not without a $300 non-Apple adapter.</p>
<p><strong>:-(</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d set my heart on just that config, now I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I might buy a 15&quot; Powerbook instead, but that drops bluetooth and Airport Extreme (which I&rsquo;m less bothered about). It also is much bigger. It does give me more CPU power, but I don&rsquo;t really want a bigger machine, plus the larger built-in screen devalues the usefulness of a second monitor almost enough for me to not be bothered. The problem is that the Powerbooks only have a VGA output, which is analogue. Humph. Maybe they&rsquo;ll change that in the interim period between now and when I buy, which is likely to be about three months.</p>
