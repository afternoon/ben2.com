<p>The EU parliament decides that software patents are a good thing, but in what way? It seems that the draft directive that was actually passed had been <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/33016.html">declawed somewhat</a>, relying on the phrase &ldquo;true inventions&rdquo; to come to the aid of the OSS community and others. Sounds like it&rsquo;s not as bad as it could have been, but that the end result is probably a fair amount of confusion. Weird.</p>
<p>That and I&rsquo;m not eschewing Lisp yet. Scary. I download Paul Graham&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a></em> in PDF form. I just read the introduction and I think I&rsquo;m starting to get it. I think the thing that everybody loves is that Lisp is programmable. Instead of writing a program in it, you end up customising the language until that program is trivial. This is demonstrated by Graham by implementing Prolog in 200 lines. I wonder how many brackets he used. Fuck loads probably.</p>
