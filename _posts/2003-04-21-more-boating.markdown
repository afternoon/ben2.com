<p>This weekend is obviously the weekend of water. Today Louise and I went out on to the Thames with Louise&rsquo;s parents in their boat. They have a 40-foot cruiser that is also their home. We met them at St Katharine&rsquo;s Dock just near Tower Bridge and plodded along the river from there to Richmond, where they put us off and we got a bus home.</p>
<p>It was really cool seeing the city from the river. I suspect that I may have been on a river cruise when I was young but I can&rsquo;t remember. It was interesting learning about the bridges! I can&rsquo;t really explain the experience very well, but I recommend it and, for now, make do with <a href="/gallery/tripdownthames/">my photos</a>.</p>
<p>Also, we just watched The American President, Aaron Sorkin&rsquo;s film prototype for The West Wing with Michael Douglas in the eponymous role. It was a crazy jumble of bits of and members of the cast of The West Wing. It was also much more schmoltzy and I enjoyed it less because of that. Still, it filled a void that no series of WW is currently filling, and whetted my appetite for the next one.</p>
