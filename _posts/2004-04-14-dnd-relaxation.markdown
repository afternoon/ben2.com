<p>If you drag a file to an app in OS X, the system will check that that application supports opening that file type. If not, you won&rsquo;t be able to open it. That&rsquo;s great, except that sometimes you need to force it, particularly with raw text files of various kinds. I just found out that by holding down alt you can force it.</p>
<p>Also, I just bound my mouse wheel click to Exposé and the various combinations to shift/command middle-click. Enabling Exposé on the mouse makes sense. Maybe I&rsquo;ll find it fits into my M.O. more naturally now.</p>
<p><em>&lt;edit date=&ldquo;15.04.2004&rdquo;&gt;Scratch that, doesn&rsquo;t seem to work at all. Wonder how it worked that once&hellip;&lt;/edit&gt;</em></p>
