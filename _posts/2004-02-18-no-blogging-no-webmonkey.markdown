<p>Sorry, haven&rsquo;t been in a bloggy mood recently. Got to write up Kenya, but at the same time work is grindingly hard at the minute and so leaves little time for free thinking.</p>
<p>I just wanted to comment on the passing of <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com">Webmonkey</a>, which has <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,62300,00.html/wn_ascii">announced it&rsquo;s closing</a>. It&rsquo;s such a sad thing. Webmonkey taught me how to do HTML. I wouldn&rsquo;t have my career if it wasn&rsquo;t for Mulder&rsquo;s CSS tutorial, Thau&rsquo;s JS tutorial and all the rest. I&rsquo;ve referred countless people to the site to cut their web teeth and I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll point them to now. I hope that somebody steps up to save them, or just to keep the site up.</p>
<p>Webmonkey RIP.</p>
