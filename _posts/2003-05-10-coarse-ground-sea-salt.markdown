<p>This is the best kitchen ingredient I have ever bought. It has made every meal we make better. Go get some!</p>
<p>Louise and I visited my parents last week and watched my Dad cooking. He&rsquo;s a very keen foody. His particular style is fairly Mediterranean, i.e. he&rsquo;ll take a courgette or a pepper and make a fantastic meal by combining it very skillfully with various spices and seasonings. I love his food and I&rsquo;ve starting trying to rip him off, hence the salt.</p>
