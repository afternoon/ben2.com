<p>I&rsquo;ve turned off FeedBurner&rsquo;s link splicing feature. Although it was quite cool, it was like I was mixing my media all wrong. Instead, if you want the total information overload, I recommend following <a href="http://friendfeed.com/afternoon">my FriendFeed</a>.</p>

<p>FriendFeed is a great service. Good for tracking my content and other peoples&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a touch inflexible in some ways, but it is easy to use and works well. More than that it&rsquo;s evolving very quickly. They added search this week and I swear they didn&rsquo;t have a Facebook app last time I looked.</p>

<p>FriendFeed has a feature to pull your friends graph from Facebook. This is great, and a requirement for any social service. The only problem is only one of my friends who record their lives online is really a Facebook user. I have lots of people as del.icio.us friends, Flickr friends and so on, creating lots of content I&rsquo;d like to track in FriendFeed, but frankly I can&rsquo;t be bothered to enter my list of friends <em>again</em>. This is a known issue in the social software world, but since FriendFeed have taken the step of yanking my Facebook friends, it would be nice to see this feature extended to other sites. Of course we really need a standard method or API for doing this, but that&rsquo;s a year out yet probably. XFN is around, but it&rsquo;s too much like hard work.</p>
