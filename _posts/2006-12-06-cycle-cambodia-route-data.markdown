<p>Phil, the Tour Manager for our Cycle Cambodia trip and all-round excellent guy, used a Garmin GPS unit along the way to keep track the route, of stops for fruit and water and the distance travelled. He exported the file from the unit using Garmin MapSource and gave it to me. I dug around and found a little utility called <a href="http://www.gpsbabel.org/">GPSBabel</a> which converts between various GPS and mapping file types and used it to create a file for Google Earth.</p>

<p>Click below to download the file, you must have <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> installed.</p>

<p>The file contains lots of stuff, the route itself, the stops for lunch and fruit, the hotels and temples we visited. Play around with the folders and stuff that appear in the sidebar when you open the file.</p>

<p>Thanks Phil for a fantastic trip and for the file!</p>
