<p>I&rsquo;ve just written a 5 page set of bullet points for a meeting where I will prove that out of basic HTML we can carve gigantic edifice-like applications. It&rsquo;s great, from tools like the file browse control and the HTTP authentication password box I can build applications that change the face of a company&rsquo;s working day. The limits are very much the stimulus for going further, creating more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m much more interested in complex web-based apps these days that basic boring brochure-ware web shites.</p>
<p>I would say more, but I <i>have</i> to sleep.</p>
