<p>Everything&rsquo;s OK. I have <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/api/index.html">reasonable documentation</a>!</p>
<p>With the help of about ten different pages, I created a simple handler module and installed it on to a virtual host by throwing stuff into my .htaccess file. I even have @INC pointing to a custom libs location so that I don&rsquo;t have to put it all into the root folder.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://mp.ben2.com/">mp.ben2.com</a>. Try sticking stuff on the end of the URL.</p>
