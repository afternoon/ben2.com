<p>I finally got around to making my own Vim colour scheme. It&rsquo;s a bit basic at the moment, there are probably a lot of Vim situations that I don&rsquo;t see so it doesn&rsquo;t cater for. But then all Vim colour schemes are defined as a set of differences from the default, so it won&rsquo;t, like, break at any point. I&rsquo;ll upload it at some point soon. I&rsquo;m working on a revised version of the <a href="/content/">content section</a> to contain much, much more stuff, so I&rsquo;ll put it up with all that.</p>
<p>By the way, I didn&rsquo;t really mention it when talking about my OCaml solution for the BCS contest, but I really like OCaml.  I&rsquo;ve been reading about Haskell more, to the point of having bought <a href="http://www.haskell.org/soe/">a Haskell book</a> today, but it does seem a little abstract. OCaml is the Perl of functional languages. It&rsquo;s powerful and it&rsquo;s really usable. It&rsquo;s got lots of syntax, unlike Lisp (the C of FP?), including good OO and imperative constructs for those times when those approaches are more useful. Now I&rsquo;m writing this I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on exactly why, but I enjoyed hacking in OCaml a lot. Although that&rsquo;s possibly because I enjoyed having my brain taxed a bit by FP and severely taxed by camlp4 parsing.</p>
