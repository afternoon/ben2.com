<p>The lovely case that Louise and I bought came today and when we tried to fit everything in it the expansion cards wouldn&rsquo;t fit! Evidently the web page &ldquo;forgot&rdquo; to mention that it only takes low profile PCI cards, which would mean being limited to PCI or onboard graphics, as you don&rsquo;t get low profile AGP cards AFAIK. It&rsquo;s a moot point as Louise and I are not about to buy any other new bits of hardware.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pity, as soon as the case came I liked it. It is very small (in all dimensions, but especially depth) and the design is pretty good for a 40 PC case, i.e. almost non-hateful. The one we&rsquo;re going to swap it for can take my GFX card, but is pretty ugly.</p>
<p>Judging by the fact that Julia (the machine) hasn&rsquo;t been upgraded since 2000, when I was given a second-hand Riva TNT 2, I&rsquo;m considering whether it would be worth it for us to limit our upgrade options by buying a really small case. Would we rather have a tiny PC than a super up-to-date one? Given that it&rsquo;s been used for games-playing about twice in the last year, it does seem silly to buy a super-spec machine that we can&rsquo;t fit in the house. However, Louise would eventually like to fit a video editing board, and I doubt they&rsquo;ll come in low-profile format.</p>
