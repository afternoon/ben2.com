<p>So I&rsquo;d forgotten the admin password. I needed to setup port forwarding so my client can see their mini-server. I thought, how am I going to change stuff without the password. After reading around for a bit it seemed the only option was to reinstall the firmware.</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t go according to plan and by five o'clock last night I had just a shell of a router that would not respond to any commands. Normally these things can be administered through a serial port if all else fails, but the key combination to boot into emergency prompt mode wasn&rsquo;t working. This morning that very much confused the guy I spoke to at technical support.</p>
<p>However, one thing did work, the key combination to boot over BOOTP. So armed with a PDF explaining what was I required, I found BOOTP and TFTP servers for Windows and managed to rebuild the whole system over ethernet. That was cool, I&rsquo;ve never done that before.</p>
<p>Then of course the configuration interface went into treacle mode. It&rsquo;s taken me the best part of an hour just to configure the ADSL, DHCP, NAT and DNS. No idea why. Now it&rsquo;s fixed though and I couldn&rsquo;t really care any more.</p>
<p>I think I might read my email&hellip;</p>
