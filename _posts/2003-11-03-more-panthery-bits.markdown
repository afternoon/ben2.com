<p>The window decor has changed for Panther. Instead of the grey and white stripes on the title, each window now sports a light grey grad fill. It&rsquo;s a bit of a return towards the creeping grey that eventually made OS 9 look so ugly, but for now it&rsquo;s OK. The gem buttons - close, minimise, etc - are now also set back into the title bar instead of sitting on it. Again, I think I prefered the old version, but it&rsquo;s not big thing.</p>
<p>What I do like is that they&rsquo;ve chucked Sendmail out of the window and installed Postfix instead. Woo hoo for a mail server that doesn&rsquo;t have to run as root!</p>
<p>Journalling is now enabled by default on HFS+ it seems. It can be disabled with the new disk utility.</p>
<p>Also SMB name resolution seems to work as well. I just asked Mart to connect to my machine and he was able to connect to <code>\\Margaret</code> rather than my IP. I didn&rsquo;t just appear in his Network Neighbourhood though, but then neither do most of the Windows machines :-)</p>
