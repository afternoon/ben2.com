I&rsquo;ve been working on Hypothetical today! I eschewed Lisp for a change and embraced PHP. I got quite a lot done. It&rsquo;s getting to the point now where it&rsquo;s pretty much succeeded the abortive <a href="http://v2.hypothetical.co.uk">v2</a>, which isn&rsquo;t saying much, but there you go.
<p>Features I implemented today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replies</li>
<li>Viewing individual messages</li>
<li>Trucking back through days of messages, a la v2</li>
<li>My messages in the My Hype area, though this is just a raw dump of message data ATM and will suffer the same problems as the v1 version. My profile page in v1 has grown to several megabytes!</li>
</ul>
