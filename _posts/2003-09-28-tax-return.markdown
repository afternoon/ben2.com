<p>Another tax return fired off. The basis period for the numbers that I submitted today ended nearly six months ago, so I had to drag lots of stuff out of my records. Luckily, as long as you keep any kind of records it&rsquo;s pretty easy. I had to muddle through some of the questions, but I did the same last year and it was fine.</p>
<p>This year I submitted online through the Inland Revenue&rsquo;s web site. The site is very good. It&rsquo;s clear and simple, provides pretty good navigation and lots of help. It&rsquo;s very stable and thorough, no page has more than a handful of form controls on it and each page is saved as soon as you navigate to another. I did about the first section and a half ages ago and the results were waiting for me when I started up again tpday.</p>
<p>The only complaint I have is that there&rsquo;s no indicator of where you are within a process. For example, the self-employment form had about 10 or 15 pages, but there was no indication of how many pages had been completed or remained or a navigation facility to jump to a specific page. This meant that when I got logged out automatically I had to click through six or seven pages to get to where I was. Not a big problem and about the only one.</p>
<p>The amount of tax I have to pay is also relaxingly low :-).</p>
<p>BTW, if you are wondering what you need to keep to be able to complete a return: I needed my invoices; details of expenses paid; documentation on interest from my banks; payments from my share brokers; details of charity gifts through Gift Aid and statements sent from the Inland Revenue.</p>
