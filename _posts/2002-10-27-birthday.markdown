<p>Wah-Hey! It&rsquo;s my birthday and I&rsquo;ll stay up until six in the morn&rsquo; if I want to! And what better way to spend a birthday than by making a new <a href="/">front page</a> for your website? I can&rsquo;t think of one.</p>
<p>Over the last week or so my laptop has been quite ill with serious disk problems. I borrowed some disk space from Jay at Underwired (thanks!) and reinstalled and now everything&rsquo;s much healthier. Which is good, because if the laptop dies, I die too, pretty much. I&rsquo;ve been working lots, producing at least three designs in the last week. None of which are very good, but I&rsquo;m having quite a good time nonetheless. My new front page design has been in the works for about a month, which is not bad going for me to complete a project.</p>
<p>Anyway, the wind has been howling all night and it is actually starting to get light now, one virtue of the clocks going back. Louise and I are going up the London Eye later (wind permitting) which I&rsquo;m well looking forward to, but I do have to get some sleep beforehand. I will try and get pictures of London from the top, but I fear my digicam won&rsquo;t really do it justice :-(.</p>
<p>Last thing about the front page is that there is more to come. My aim is to make it so it never really stops moving. The version that I have uploaded now has four seperate looping animations. I hope to get time to add in another three or four and to generally liven up the background grey meshwork. This will really give it the feeling of being alive, which is what I want. For now, enjoy!</p>
