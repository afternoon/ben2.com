<p>I got bored of orange, so I ditched it. The new design sucks for several reasons. It&rsquo;s just the front page rehashed, and I don&rsquo;t want the nav cluttering up the top of the page, but obviously I can&rsquo;t do without it (answers on <a href="/mail/">a postcard</a>). Also it&rsquo;s really just a bit dull. Still, at least it&rsquo;s a change.</p>
<p>I need to tidy up the code behind the journal a bit as well, but that&rsquo;s just another thing on the huge list of things that will never ever get done :-).</p>
