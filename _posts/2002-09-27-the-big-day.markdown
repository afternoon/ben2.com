<p>The Big Day is getting closer. I&rsquo;ve just been to the pub to say a final goodbye to all the people I used to work with at Soup. On Tuesday I said goodbye to Tai Chi and we went for a meal with many of my closest friends at Pizza Express. So I&rsquo;ve bid farewell to almost everybody, just the few close friends to say a final goodbye to. I think I&rsquo;ll be back down the pub tonight to finish off, leaving only City Road and Thickthorn really.</p>
<p>All this saying goodbye belies the fact that we&rsquo;ve got a fuckload of packing and general sorting out to do. We still don&rsquo;t have any idea how we&rsquo;re going to get proper TV (i.e. more than terrestrial) and we don&rsquo;t really even know if we&rsquo;re going to be able to fit everything into our new house! We&rsquo;ve got a van sorted and Louise will be driving down as well. After that it&rsquo;s very much a blank. I&rsquo;ve got to return my library books&hellip;</p>
<p>Hmmm, slightly scared, slightly sad, slightly confused, fairly excited. My prevailing emotion is one of standoffishness. It will happen next week. Until then, I can&rsquo;t really be bothered :-)</p>
