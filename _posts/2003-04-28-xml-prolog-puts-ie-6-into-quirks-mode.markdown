<p>For a while I&rsquo;ve been aware that there is a problem with including the XML prolog (<code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;</code>) in XHTML documents, but nobody has explained what it was and I didn&rsquo;t bother to go looking. However, it puts IE 6 into &ldquo;render like IE 5&rdquo; mode which seems pretty dumb, however, it answers a few questions.</p>
<p>I will be removing the prolog from the pages on this site sometime soon.</p>
