<p>I just found out about the Blogger API. It&rsquo;s an XML-RPC API for editing and creating posts remotely. It&rsquo;s greatest usefulness is that a batch of already written standard blog editing tools, such as <a href="http://www.webentourage.com/blogapp.php">BlogApp</a> can be used to manage a weblog. BlogApp has handy stuff like a spelling checker and buttons to insert HTML.</p>
<p>Problem is that whilst I can find implementations of a client I can&rsquo;t find a server implementation in PHP. Which means I may have to up and code it myself. Which means that I have another week long project on my already GIGANTIC to do list. I need minions!</p>
