<p>I thought this was nice. Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gylenhaal and John C Reilly were all really excellent. The plot didn&rsquo;t go as deep as it could have done and it tied up a little neatly for me, but the key thing was that it was believable. It&rsquo;s so rare to find people with believable flaws. People who, in the words of Charlie Kaufman, don&rsquo;t learn life lessons through adversity, but carry on as they always were. Aniston&rsquo;s character Justine has a brush with a different life, every step of the way it looks like she might not be able to return to her marriage as it was before, but in the end she pulls it together like nothing had ever happened.</p>
