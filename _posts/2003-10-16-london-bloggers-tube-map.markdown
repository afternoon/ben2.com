<p>Today <a href="http://ninj4.org/">Mat</a> found <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/misc/londonbloggers/">London Bloggers Tube Map</a>. A site where you can catalogue your blog according to your nearest tube station and view others in your area. There are 644 people registered already, which is pretty cool.</p>
<p>Given my burning desire to make new friends in London, I&rsquo;ve decided to try and arrange a meeting for Fulham and nearby bloggers. This basically means sending an email to everybody listed under Fulham Broadway, Parson&rsquo;s Green, West Brompton, Putney Bridge, Gloucester Road, Earl&rsquo;s Court, Hammersmith, Baron&rsquo;s Court, West Kensington and perhaps even South Kensington. Each of these tube stops is within walking distance of here. South Ken is probably a good twenty or thirty minute walk, but that&rsquo;t the furthest.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of people in the area. I hope some of them will come out for a meetup. I may have to lure them with beer, we shall see.</p>
