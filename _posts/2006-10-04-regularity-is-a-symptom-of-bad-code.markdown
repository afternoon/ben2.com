<p>Paul Graham, in his essay <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">Revenge of the Nerds</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I&rsquo;m using abstractions that aren&rsquo;t powerful enough - often that I&rsquo;m generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.</blockquote>
<p>This has really stuck in my head! I keep thinking it when I write code. It&rsquo;s like a little angel sitting on my shoulder saying &ldquo;No. No, Afternoon, abstract this, use a list comprehension, create a function, or a class, or a higher-order function, don&rsquo;t just be lazy.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a force for good.</p>
