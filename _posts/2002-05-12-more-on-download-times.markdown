<p>One saving grace about download times is that a lot of images can be shared between pages. If the home page HTML is 2k, then it and 32k of graphics can be download in under ten seconds, subsequent pages can then be up to 34k if they only use the same graphics as the home page. This is an ass as the most important page, the home page, is the one burdened with the job of bringing in the heavy graphics. Also, if the user enters the site via another page, and does not have the images cached, it will take 20 seconds to download. So, not that great an idea really.</p>
