<p>I went to an auction of lost property and stolen stuff recovered by the police at <a href="http://lloyds-auction.co.uk/">Lloyds Auction House</a> in Wandsworth to try and buy a new bike.</p>
<p>There were loads of bikes. Most were quite shabby, often just dirt, but quite a few had some problems like rusty chains, stuck derailleurs, that kind of thing. There were a couple of really quite nice bikes there too, a Specialized, a few nice Raleighs, etc. I wasn&rsquo;t quite prepared to inspect the bikes as thoroughly as required, I didn&rsquo;t have any paper for example, so I decided just to watch rather than buy. I had a list of about ten bikes that I was interested in.</p>

<p>They had loads of other stuff to clear out first, which I didn&rsquo;t expect, and that took a while so I only stayed to hear the sales of a small number of bike lots. Many of them were grouped into twos and threes and they seemed to be going for anything from £10 to £160 with the average probably being about £40. Bear in mind that&rsquo;s for several bikes, but will also have VAT and buyer&rsquo;s premium (35% combined) on top. You had to put down a £40 deposit to bid, but that was refundable.</p>
<p>So overall, like anything, it&rsquo;s possible to get a bargain if you&rsquo;re prepared to put the work in.</p>
<ul><li>Give yourself an hour for viewing</li><li>Take paper to make notes on the bikes/stuff you&rsquo;re interested in</li><li>Set a maximum price that you&rsquo;re willing to pay for each item</li><li>When the auction starts be impassionate, just let it happen</li></ul>
<p>Or at least that&rsquo;s what intend to do when I go back. Phone Lloyds to find out when the auctions are if you want to go too!</p>
