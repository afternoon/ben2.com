<p>Or &ldquo;My customers can&rsquo;t find anything on my site!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very tricky problem in web design is how to organise the information on the site into categories. Card sorting solves this problem in a way that&rsquo;s really pretty obvious.</p>
<p>You write out the items you&rsquo;re going to have on the site on cards (assume for a moment we&rsquo;re just talking about a bunch of simple documents you want to publish). Then you take that stack of cards and ask a customer to group them for you. Take a note of what they do, then go see another customer and ask them. Do this with a few customers, the client and maybe some other people and then look what consensus arises.</p>
<p>Frickin&rsquo; obvious. Gold dust. Thank you <em>DoS</em>.</p>
