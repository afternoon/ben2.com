<p>Our mentor just sent me this quote by business strategist Peter F. Drucker.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we failed to do with Cohack, and aren&rsquo;t doing enough in Moblog. Sitting down and saying, this is the decision, it might be wrong, it might be right, we hope it&rsquo;s right, but whatever happens we&rsquo;ve got to stick by it. We&rsquo;ve got to execute. We&rsquo;re a group of people who don&rsquo;t have management experience, we&rsquo;re bottom-rung knowledge workers, I produce web pages for example. My stock and trade is HTML, CSS et al, not delegating. That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m going to need to learn, when someone else should be pulling their weight and when I should be, otherwise we&rsquo;ll perpetuate the current situation, a constant self-feeding storm of ideas and emails that never go anyway, that never get past the &ldquo;Interesting&rdquo; stage.</p>
