<p><a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2003/09/20#a1762">Java is the SUV of programming tools</a>.</p>
<p>Is the quick and dirty use of languages like Perl just quick, because the long way always ends up dirty anyway?</p>
<p>Why are Lisp people so snobbish? The number of pages I&rsquo;ve read where people say things like &ldquo;Knowing Lisp is the pinnacle of programming enlightenment is affirming a (less well-known) truth.&rdquo; amazes me. What amazes me more is that nobody is prepared to take me by the hand and show me why Lisp is best. If it really is so good, wouldn&rsquo;t it pain them to see people using other languages? How do they explain the proliferation of other languages? When I see people I know doing things wrong, I offer advice. I try to make things easier and save them time - it&rsquo;s The Laziness of Programmersâ„¢. Why are the Lisp ranks so clandestine (yes I have seen the syntax).</p>
<p>I like to think I&rsquo;m language agnostic. Changing languages often makes me happiest. I&rsquo;ve been writing lots of Java recently, so when I opened up a C++ file the other day, it looked really good. Compared to Java, C++ is nicely minimal and hard looking. That&rsquo;s just the aesthetic though. In terms of use, I&rsquo;m not really sure about what I prefer. Sure my development time in PHP is quicker, but often the bugs I&rsquo;m chasing might well have been caught by Java&rsquo;s stronger checking. I really don&rsquo;t like debugging C memory management code though.</p>
<p>Still, I find myself compiling <code>clisp</code> as I type. Hmmm. Should be working.</p>
