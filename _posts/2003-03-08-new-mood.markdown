<p>I can never remember what films I&rsquo;ve seen. I can do books because they&rsquo;re significantly more of a life investment. But I just keep forgetting the films. I see about three or four a week on TV/DVD and go to the cinema once every two weeks probably.</p>
<p>This flaw has been particuarly highlighted recently by my flatmate Tom. He is a runner at an ad production company and part of his job is to find stuff for mood reels. A mood reel is where you get shots from other films/ads/TV programmes to illustrate the kind of thing you&rsquo;re going to do in a new production. He&rsquo;ll come home and say, &ldquo;What films have people shooting themselves in?&rdquo; and stuff like that. Anyway, I can never remember, so now I&rsquo;m going to try and log what I saw and what I thought. I think I&rsquo;ll do books and records as well. Any media intake really.</p>
<p>The name of the mood refers to the fact that I&rsquo;m going to play the critic. I won&rsquo;t be uniformly critical in the negative sense. Generally I&rsquo;m pretty upbeat about things if I even vaguely like them.</p>
