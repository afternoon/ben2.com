<p>kid606 albums duck and dive. The last one was minimal soundscapes. This one is massive hardcore. In many ways it sounds like kid606 does Bogdan, which could be a good thing. It&rsquo;s a bit tired though.</p>
<p>Some bits are undoubtedly &lsquo;ardcore (inherently a good thing), but a lot of it is just trotting out the same samples and effects in an effort to press buttons. It sounds he&rsquo;s shouting &ldquo;I REALLY FUCKING WANT TO MAKE A GREAT FUCKING ALBUM!!!&rdquo;, which is a shame. Some of the tracks are more thoroughly thought out that others, but the overall impression is pretty similar to that of <em>Go Plastic</em> unfortunately.</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s not unlistenable, it&rsquo;s just not as good as it should be/everyone says it is.</p>
