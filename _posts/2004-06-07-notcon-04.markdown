<p>Just got back from NotCon, could have blogged while I was there, but was busy on the IRC chan - <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/notcon">irc://irc.freenode.net/notcon</a> (<a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/pjm2/notcon/">log</a>). I really enjoyed the day, the highlight for me was the group. I really liked being hooked up to a busy network and chatting to people on IRC in the background. Tom Coates of <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">plasticbag.org</a> (who I met at the blogmeet a few weeks ago) had <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> running and was using it to take notes. All the Panther users contributed, including me. The <a href="http://aftnn.org/stuff/journal_src/notcon.txt">final file</a> is a treasure trove, especially as I missed the first couple of hours. It was just great editing the file and contributing and it was much slicker than a wiki.</p>
<p>The talks were pretty good, the political stuff downstairs was the most interesting IMHO. The techie stuff was a bit obvious really. I would link to everything, but all the URLs are on the <a href="http://www.xcom2002.com/nc04/">NotCon pages</a>. The best stuff was Tim Ireland&rsquo;s MPs and Weblogs and, of course, Alex McLean (of Dorkbot) and his live hardcore coding.</p>
<p>Phew, bit tired now. Might blog more when more awake.</p>
