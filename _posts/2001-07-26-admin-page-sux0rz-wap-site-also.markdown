<p>The admin page takes ages and ages and ages to load. This is because it&rsquo;s loads of stuff lumped into one page. The solution is modularisation. The site needs a proper Admin _AREA_ instead. Modules include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Threads</li>
<li>Files</li>
<li>Themes</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus any others that turn up in the process of redesign.</p>
<p>The completed version needs to be secure as well, although I can&rsquo;t see why I need to go much further than the PHP user login combined with the htaccess password.</p>
<p>Off-topic, the WAP microsite needs a complete rethink also. It&rsquo;s probably possible to get PHP to encode the session keys into link URLs, thus providing better security without cookies. God I hope sessions fix all my log-in troubles, God knows I haven&rsquo;t got any better ideas.</p>
