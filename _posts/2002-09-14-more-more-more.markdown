<p>I&rsquo;ve added a <a href="/content/gengl/">new content section</a>. It&rsquo;s a bunch of images I created by randomly creating geometry with OpenGL calls and then dumping the output. It&rsquo;s not very sophis, but the images are quite nice. I did them about 18 months ago, during the winter at Clarence Road.</p>
<p>The sharp-eyed amongst you will also notice that I&rsquo;ve plonked a new background in here at the journal. Whilst I&rsquo;m quite proud of the texture which is about 7kb and tiles really nicely, it just doesn&rsquo;t fit with the rest of the imagery. I&rsquo;m going to replace it with something a bit more technical.</p>
