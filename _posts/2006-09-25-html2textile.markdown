<p>Also (wait around for ages, then two come along, etc), I&rsquo;ve written a little HTML to <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> converter in Python. I&rsquo;ve been using Textile more and more because of it&rsquo;s brevity and because it removes all ability to do much more than write text. You don&rsquo;t need the full power of HTML layout for writing blog posts.</p>

<p>Get it here: <a href="http://aftnn.org/stuff/code/html2textile.py">html2textile: HTML to Textile converter</a>.</p>

<p>Or: <a href="http://aftnn.org/content/code/html2textile/">browse the source in colour</a>.</p>
