<p>Sun don&rsquo;t provide any mock exams for the Certified Java Programmer exam that I&rsquo;m going to sit. <a href="http://java.about.com/cs/freejavaexams/index.htm">About.com</a> do though. Thanks About! I got 17 out of 30, which would scrape a pass mark (it&rsquo;s a 50% exam) just about, and demonstrates that I need to do a bit of revision on some of the tricky technicalities.</p>
<p>I always have mixed feelings about About. They have one of the best collections of content on the net and have done for years and years. Their idea is cool and works well. Often there are questions where the experts at About are the only people publishing the right answers.</p>
<p>On the other hand they are terrible advert whores. They popup with every single page load. With the quiz I was doing, the answer would be popped up in a window which would contain a body of explanation - very handy. Then the window would redirect to another About page full of sponsored links and stuff, within about ten seconds. I had to run the test by quickly copying the explanation and pasting it into an email window. Stupidness. I think they maybe risk their userbase by annoying them with so many adverts. It can&rsquo;t be good.</p>
