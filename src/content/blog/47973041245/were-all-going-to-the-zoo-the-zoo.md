<p><a href="http://aftnn.org/gallery/zoo/">Zoo</a>!</p>
<p>We were really rushed because we&rsquo;re so slack, we only got there at about four and had about an hour and a half to get around 36 acres of beasts. We saw the major things we wanted to catch: lions, tigers, giraffes, gorillas, chimpanzees, gold-headed lion tamarins, sloth bears, anacondas and more. We missed the fish and the bugs unfortunately as well as quite a lot of other things. Still it was an adventure. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll go back again fairly soon and be a bit more organised next time.</p>
<p>It was good to spend the weekend taking advantage of one of the many cultural experiences London has to offer. We&rsquo;ve done so few since we arrived, it&rsquo;s a real shame. Going to the zoo was pretty much a result of watching <em>American Beauty</em> on Friday and going &ldquo;Life&rsquo;s great! Let&rsquo;s embrace it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom spent the weekend building a model scene to use to shoot a test of an effect the company he works for are considering using in one of their productions. He spent ages lovingly creating a house and garden scene, replete with archways, grass, benches, walls and everything else. He worked on it last night as I watched <em>The Music Of Chance</em>, a film in which a poker player and his new found friend get on the wrong side of some creepy millionaire model makers. It all got a little surreal to be honest. Still, the film was good, even if it lacked a real ending.</p>
<p>Plus our little tortoise friend, Madonna, has been returned to her actual owner, Louise&rsquo;s mum, leaving a gap in our front room. A nice gap actually, that I&rsquo;m glad to see again.</p>
