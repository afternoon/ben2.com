<p>Just bought a new Nokia N73. It&rsquo;s not even activated yet and I&rsquo;m sure it will be great when it is, but the hands free that it ships with is rubbish.</p>
<p>Ever since phones started having ambitions to be music players, their hands free kits have become dual-earpiece. This extra feature has a nasty side effect. They tangle instantly and forever more. Mine&rsquo;s done it already. I actually just want to use it for making calls. So I picked up a traditional single-earpiece kind on eBay for all of a quid.</p>
