<p>I enjoyed it. Not the Budweiser mind. I drank about a thousand and still came out only mildly happy. They were Â£3.50 each as well. Three fucking fifty.</p>
<p>End of rant.</p>
<p>Otherwise it was an interesting evening. I met some people with quite well known blogs, including Simon of <a href="http://www.minor9th.com/">Minor 9th</a>, a Guardian blog contest winner and a very nice young man. There were lots of nice people there. We talked about the nature of blogs of quite a lot and the differing views were interesting, blogs as journalism, blogs as publishing, blogs as diaries. Most interestingly, blogs as enterprise tools.</p>
<p>I kind of expecting more people talking about software and sociology and the possibilities for business and large scale projects. There wasn&rsquo;t much of that at all. Which I guess isn&rsquo;t so surprising, the people there were more into personal expression on a techie media than software engineers per se. It&rsquo;s made me really excited about NotCon though!</p>
<p>Incidentally, I didn&rsquo;t talk to Cory. Ladislav did though&hellip;</p>
