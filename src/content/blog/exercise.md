<p>I don&rsquo;t get out much. I work from home and I generally end up working fairly hard. I have to make myself leave the house. Recently I have been practicing work fairly well, getting up at eight and working until five, taking an hour or so break during the day and going outside.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been mapping out the area in a series of long walks starting here and looping broadly around Fulham. I have also been known to run. Though only once and my feet hurt afterwards because I ran in skate shoes. I&rsquo;d like to carry on, so I&rsquo;m looking at getting a pair of proper running shoes, AKA wide-boy trainers, when I can afford them.</p>
<p>This morning I decided to go out for a walk first thing. I have been thinking about it because I sit at my machine rather restlessly all day, having to wander about the flat a bit every half an hour. It makes sense to stretch my legs first. Indeed everybody else does it and I have found in the past that the journey to work in the mornings is useful for getting properly woken up. When I discovered that we had no milk I knew the time had come.</p>
<p>I passed a nice looking dentist on Munster Road as well. I&rsquo;ve signed up for a registration appointment with one on Fulham High Road, but I walked past that one (unintentionally) last night and it looked a bit grubby whereas this one was really sparkly. I&rsquo;m in two minds but I may cancel my appointment and get one at the nearer place. The quality of the decor probably doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the quality of the treatment, but it does say a little something about the equipment. Actually, scratch that, the fact that the place is nicely kitted out probably means that the dentists are good at extorting money from private customers. Something I don&rsquo;t intend to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, exercise. I&rsquo;ve been doing minor in-house exercises as well, sit-ups, push-ups and so on. Later on today I intend to go and explore the local swimming pool. It will be the first time I&rsquo;ve been swimming for about a year. The pool is a public part of a swanky private gym, so the facilities should also be swanky.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to six-pack abs and upper arms of steel! Not really, here&rsquo;s to not dying of heart disease for at least a couple of decades.</p>
