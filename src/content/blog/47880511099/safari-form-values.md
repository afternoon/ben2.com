<p>Got sick of Safari pausing for five or six seconds after a form is submitted, so it can update it&rsquo;s Form Values file. Deleted it. Is this the end for my use of the internet? Can I actually remember stuff without Safari doing it for me?</p>

<p>Nah, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be fine&hellip;</p>
