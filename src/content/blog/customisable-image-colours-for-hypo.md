<p>Simple really, should of thought of it earlier. Instead of hacking around trying to get GD to load TrueType fonts I can just create the text as transparent GIFs and superimpose them on to whatever colour backgrounds with GD. This will work for both frames and has the advantage that all the buttons in all the themes folder can be replaced with one function in the inc file.</p>
<p>All this will be part of the <b>NEW <font size="+1">ENHANCED</font> <font size="+2">THEME</font> <font size="+3">ENGINE</font></b>.</p>
