<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of photography, I find it dull and repetitive mostly. It&rsquo;s a difficult form in which to distinguish yourself I think. On a trip to New York a few years ago I came across a work by Andreas Gursky, <em><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/phdu/hob_1995.191.htm">Schiphol</a></em>. A work of hyper-realism and amazing technique. Then last year at the <a href="http://www.affordableartfair.co.uk/">Affordable Art Fair</a> in Regent&rsquo;s Park I saw a piece by <a href="http://www.vanessabeecroft.com/">Vanessa Beecroft</a> (check out VB48 and VB50). Though Beecroft&rsquo;s art is in the performance rather than the photographs of it. At the beginning of the summer Louise and I went to see the Frida Kahlo exhibition at the Tate Modern and while waiting for our slot (it was busy!) we browsed their poster collection. There was a really nice photograph by Damien Hirst, <em><a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/pharmacy/">Pharmacy</a></em>. In the V&amp;A exhibition <em><a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1369_between_past_future/">Between Past And Future</a></em> I saw some stuff I really liked, particularly Wang Qingsong&rsquo;s <em>Night Revels of Lao Li</em> and the untitled signature image by An Hong - &ldquo;&lsquo;Buddha&rsquo; may be the monarch who blesses and protects our paths toward a life of kitsch.&rdquo; The big hyperreal tableaux is an image I&rsquo;ve seen a few times recently and I really like it. I like an image you can wallow in for a while, appreciating every part of the form. I&rsquo;m not big on representational art and for me these images offer much beauty.</p>
