<p>Charles Kennedy is no Tony Blair, but his party is growing year on year. The Liberal Democrats have, by slow and sure hard work, created a party which is perceived to deliver good councillors, back bench MPs and particularly MEPs. Their strong showing in this week&rsquo;s elections is interesting, but the European parliament votes aren&rsquo;t released until tomorrow. I&rsquo;m interested to see what happens.</p>
<p>I personally voted Green for London Assembly and the EU, I think the same &ldquo;steady base&rdquo; label can be applied to them. They are the only party who mentioned the EUCD and software patents as campaign issues, which was the deciding factor for me.</p>
<p>If the Liberal Democrats can produce a leader who is more charismatic than Charles Kennedy, who is a good politician, but doesn&rsquo;t have the superstar potential sadly required to become prime minister, they might be able to make surprising gains in the next few general electons.</p>
<p>Maybe they should recruit Ken Livingstone&hellip; ;-)</p>
