<p>OK, it&rsquo;s by a group called Macho (appropriately). <a href="http://www.discomusic.com/records/macho.html">Here is more info</a>.</p>
<p>That site linked me to <a href="http://www.gemm.com/">GEMM</a>, which would appear to be an online archive of the stock of loads of independent record stores around the world. They showed me to the door of a shop that had the tune and let me buy it online. Presumably they&rsquo;ll deliver the cash to my man and my vinyl will be here ASAP. To continue todays exclamation theme, this is the best service ever! Goodbye sweet debit card! Man, I fucking love the internet so much.</p>
