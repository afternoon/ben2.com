<p>Yesterday Microsoft announced that there would be no more versions of Internet Explorer on the Mac. They actually said that <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,59257,00.html">people should use Safari instead</a>. In the discussion of this point on various sites (<a href="http://tantek.com/log/2003/06.html#endofmacie">Tantek</a>, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0603a.shtml#ju1303">Zeldman</a>) I learned that MS had previously mentioned that there <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/itcommunity/chats/trans/ie/ie0507.asp">wouldn&rsquo;t be anymore standalone releases of IE/PC either</a>, that it would all be part of the OS only from now on. Microsoft is effectively leaving the browser market.</p>
<p>But hang on, Microsoft owns the browser market, with over 90% share. So they&rsquo;re leaving it for dead (ish). There will be no advancement in functionality on the desktops of 90% of the world&rsquo;s web users until 2005, it seems, when Longhorn is released. By which point the W3C will probably have shed their earthy bounds and evolved into a race of super-beings and we&rsquo;ll all be living on Mars.</p>
<p>What are we standards-loving hippy web devs to do between now and then? I hate IE 6. I have done for a while now. It&rsquo;s 18 months old and due for replacement and now I&rsquo;m being told that I&rsquo;ve got to put up with the same useless browser engine for the next two years! It&rsquo;s sad that nobody will upgrade. I guess people will migrate from IE/Mac to Safari pretty solidly, but that&rsquo;s little consolation against the static edifice that is IE/PC usage. I can&rsquo;t even get Louise to upgrade, let alone Joe Punter! If 90% of web users suddenly decided to upgrade from IE to Firebird, I would literally cry. Mainly because it&rsquo;s so unfeasibly unlikely.</p>
<p>The worst thing is the idea that nothing will happen between now and 2005. Nothing at all, in two years, in the internet business. It&rsquo;s an Ice Age.</p>
<p>Yours, Frustrated of Fulham.</p>
