<p>The <a href="http://rdfweb.org/foaf/">&ldquo;Friend of a friend&rdquo; project</a> is pretty self-evident (which is a good thing). They have a format and are encouraging people to create FOAF-formatted data (<a href="http://aftnn.org/media/afternoon.foaf">mine is here</a>) but they haven&rsquo;t quite got to the point of implementing distribution and search functions.</p>
<p>A search engine is the obvious function for the data, though none seems to be around yet. It <i>is</i> early in the project at the moment. Also, that search engine really should provide it&rsquo;s data as a web service.</p>
