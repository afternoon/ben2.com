<p>Community page wants some kind of grid layout (3 by x, 4 by x), with the playas organised by post count. Kill the graph but keep the numbers. The grid gives me the idea of ID cards, not quite to the point of having photos, but something a bit more useable and exciting than the current page.</p>
<p>Handy feature: when a user logs in put up a one-time message providing a link to the last post from a user, select by day or limit and write in an anchor for jumping.</p>
