<p>If you are thinking about your employment status and wondering about the possibility of getting a new job, my advice would be to get started as early as possible. Getting a job on-demand in a hurry sucks and is intensely stressful. I tried this about two years ago and got pretty much nowhere.</p>
<p>Lately though I&rsquo;m getting stacks of job offers, 1-2 a week and some of them pretty serious. Because of my earlier drive to contact agencies and potential employers, my CV has now done the rounds and got me out there. To paraphrase Goldie Looking Chain:</p>
<blockquote><em>“On internet sites and computer mainframes,<br/>recruiters obsess about the size of my brains.”</em></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of nice, even though I have no intention of accepting any of them.</p>
