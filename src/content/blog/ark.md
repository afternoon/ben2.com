<p>I went and had a look at the <a href="http://www.thelondonark.co.uk/">Ark</a> today. It&rsquo;s a big ark-shaped building on the A4, just at Hammersmith Broadway. It was pretty cool. I was just cheekily looking around the side when a 50-something white suit guy stopped me and asked what I was doing. When I told him however, that I was just looking at the building, he agreed that it was pretty cool and we talked about the inside a little bit. It was a pleasant encounter with a nice guy.</p>
<p>Looking at the pictures on that site, it looks even cooler inside. I have to get in there!</p>
