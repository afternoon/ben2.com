<p>I did another installation today. Last week I wore a suit and it didn&rsquo;t work. Today I didn&rsquo;t wear a suit and, despite a few minor teething problems, it worked <em>and</em> I got free ice cream. I got let out at four as well so I went and had a pint outside just off Tottenham Court Road and read my book. I&rsquo;m trying to finish <a href="http://www.xenatera.com/hackingthexbox/index.html">Hacking the Xbox</a> before I go away on Saturday morning, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s very likely. I&rsquo;m into the appendices now, but they&rsquo;re things like soldering techniques and so pretty interesting for somebody like me who knows nothing about electronics.</p>
