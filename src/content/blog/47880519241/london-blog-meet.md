<p><strong>May 12th - The International</strong></p>
<p>Loads of people will be going from the looks of <a href="http://joi.ito.com/joiwiki/LoicLondonMay04">the page</a> (curiously hosted by Joi Ito who is, AFAIK, in Japan). It&rsquo;s just a little bar restaurant.</p>
<p>I will use the event to expose Hype a bit and network and possibly put my feelers out to find out more about <a href="http://www.notcon04.com/">NotCon</a>. And I&rsquo;ll be in the same room as Cory Doctorow, who is like a blog superstar, even though he doesn&rsquo;t really have a blog. AFAIK.</p>
