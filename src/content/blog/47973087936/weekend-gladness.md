<p><a href="http://ninj4.org/">Mat</a> shipped me his mixer. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.vestax.com/products/pmc05proII.htm">Vestax PMC-05 Pro II</a> and it beats the pants out of my old one. The crossfader was so shagged on it as to be useless (leaky on both sides) even if you could muster the strength to push it across. Still them days is gone and now I can chop to my heart&rsquo;s content. Thanks Mat!</p>
<p>Louise and I went shopping yesterday. We don&rsquo;t shop really. I buy stuff compulsively night and day but online mostly. Louise doesn&rsquo;t shop because she has very little spending money. As I&rsquo;ve been bringing in a fair amount recently I gave her an allowance and demanded she buy clothes. She bought a nice cream linen suit and a lovely pink top and some other bits. Job well done. I also wanted to buy some clothes, but no where has trousers baggy enough for me any more, :-(.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to get some new glasses soon as well. I went into a store to try some frames and a sales guy asked me what I was looking for. &ldquo;Something a bit more up to date&rdquo; I replied. He turned to Louise and joked &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he said that and not me!&rdquo; I took it in good humour, but it confirmed my hunch that it&rsquo;s seriously time to upgrade. I went into Vision Express on Oxford Street expecting usual high street opticians fare. No, it&rsquo;s designer boutique central. I&rsquo;m going to get some superfly George Clooney sunglasses I reckon. I&rsquo;m sick of the fashion dark ages, where&rsquo;s my wallet..?</p>
