<p>Over at the Mobloplex we&rsquo;ve been having fun putting together the <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/blog/valentines">Moblog UK Valentine&rsquo;s Day competition</a>. It&rsquo;s really three competitions in one, with prizes for the cutest couple as well as the best batchelor and batchelorette. We don&rsquo;t like to exclude anyone.</p>

<p>We want to see your pictures! You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of the site, just send a picture from your computer or your phone to <a href="mailto:valentines@moblg.net">valentines@moblg.net</a>. From your phone you can use your email application or just send an MMS to that address.</p>
