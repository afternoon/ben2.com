<p>I think I worked it out today. I was in discussion with JC and with a couple of guys we got talking to in a pub in Southwark. I made the assertion that all the protesters at the pre-war protest and tomorrow&rsquo;s protest can&rsquo;t simply be anti-war. War is a fact of life today, as hateful and as shockingly horrible as it is, it happens a lot. All too much. No, I think that the protesters are out because they know that as much as Bush protests his innocence and his mission to spread democracy and peace, he&rsquo;s lying. The protesters know that there are many things he could be doing to make the world a fairer and happier place, but he just isn&rsquo;t. Iraq is a stupid war, but what makes it stupid is that there are so many countries that are commiting injustices and crimes that are just as horrible, but they get away with it! Israel is an example, with it&rsquo;s annexing of territory belonging to Libya and Lebanon,  China is another. These are examples of many countries with terrible oppressive and also expansionist regimes. It&rsquo;s because Bush really doesn&rsquo;t care that people are protesting today.</p>
