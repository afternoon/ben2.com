<p>Another site goes live. It should be two by now, but I&rsquo;ve so busy that I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to sort out the minor problems on the second project. Anyway, the <a href="http://www.dmamembership.org.uk/">DMA Membership Microsite</a> is finished, packed with more Javascript cunning than any other site I&rsquo;ve built so far. It got very stressful today (and the last two days), we were quite late and it was an important project for the guys who hired me.</p>
<p>The problems we had were due to lack of testing. This seems to be my main problem in terms of site development. At the crunch I get stressed and put the delivery ahead of the quality checking. After the crunch this means that errors often creep in and push the delivery back much further than 15 minutes good testing ever could.</p>
