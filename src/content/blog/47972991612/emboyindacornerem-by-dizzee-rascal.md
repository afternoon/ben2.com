<p>Look sharp!</p>
<p>Hardcore, stylish, brave, did I say hardcore? It&rsquo;s like Peaches for non-feminists ;-). Apparently his music teacher helped out, but his breadth of influences is pretty impressive. It&rsquo;s his first album and he&rsquo;s young, but it&rsquo;s the brittle production and simple technique that many first albums suffer from that makes this a gem, especially now that it&rsquo;s really overground.</p>
<p>As I listen to it more, what I like most about it is it&rsquo;s him. It&rsquo;s not his gang, or his love, just him, alone in the world, watching.</p>
<p>Soundtrack to every drive to the shops, gangster style.</p>
