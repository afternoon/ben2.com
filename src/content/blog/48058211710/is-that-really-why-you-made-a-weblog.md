<p>No. The real reason is I found myself sending myself a lot of email. This is my main way of keeping notes about life in general, mostly about <a href="http://hypothetical.co.uk/">Hypothetical</a>. So I&rsquo;m going to post all that shit here from now on, when I&rsquo;m in a webmasterly mood.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a load of back-dated crap:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove all isset and replace with !empty</li>
<li>Moot idea of developing a Flash HTML editor.</li>
<li>Add more stuff to the user profile, dowse the anonymity factor a bit. Maybe this will be good for the community.</li>
<li>Add logic to post a special message to the front page with new user details!</li>
<li>&ldquo;Use file in message&hellip;&rdquo; link on profile and files pages.</li>
<li>What about the download script 64k nonsense?</li>
<li>More folder structure is required (i.e. some).</li>
<li>All the modularity should be done with classes, although this depends on the schematic. If the glove fits&hellip; Functions work really well anyway, they just don&rsquo;t take care of the data anywhere near as well.</li>
<li>Sessions all the way.</li>
<li>Chunkification of message/file/user/thread lists into blocks of 25 or
something, with links to navigate through the pages. Tricky one on the
backend this.</li>
<li>Go with indices in the database, keeping uname in the user table. When
deleting a user provide the option to move a users messages to another
username first. The tacit assumption is that no user should be deleted
unless they have a replacement login.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you&rsquo;re never going to see anything interesting on this log. If I have something to say, I&rsquo;ll post it to Hypothetical, because I&rsquo;ll want people to read it and shout at me (if you get my meaning).</p>
