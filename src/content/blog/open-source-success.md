<p>In a recent revision of Django (not exactly sure which) my patches for my tickets <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3160">#3160</a> and <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3162">#3162</a> were added to the trunk.</p>

<p>After all these years of hanging around open source, I have finally made a code contribution which has made it into a release. The contributions are very small, but I hope they will be my first baby steps.</p>

<p>Yay!</p>
