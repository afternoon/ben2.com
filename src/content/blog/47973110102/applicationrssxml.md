<p>I downloaded <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> last night to check it out. It&rsquo;s an RSS browser for OS X. It&rsquo;s pretty good. I&rsquo;ve had trouble with being too addicted to the news before though and I don&rsquo;t see this helping that at all! There&rsquo;s just much better things to do than spend ages trying to keep up with the ever shifting world of facts. I don&rsquo;t advocate being out of touch, I just think balance is important. Recently my news needs are kind of handled for me. Louise works as a journalist and either mentions or posts anything interesting to Hype. The same with other people. Like taking drugs through a dog, I use other people as bullshit filters.</p>
<p>Still, it got me looking at RSS. Its traditional RDF variation is a fairly dense grammar. Easy to do but heavy. Then I looked at <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/feed/zeldman.xml">Zeldman&rsquo;s file</a>, which is dead simple (view source to see the XML). It works just as well with NNW. It lacks time values, but then so do most of the RDF feeds.</p>
<p>So, the upshot is, I spent half an hour hacking and now my site has an RSS feed. Woo! Click it to your left.</p>
