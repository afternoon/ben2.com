<p><strong>What: Developers and Startups Match Making<br/>

<p>Startups need developers.</p>

<p>Developers like cool jobs.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get together!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a wide range of startups emerging in London and a great developer community. When the two combine, everybody wins. I&rsquo;m organising an evening with just this purpose in mind.</p>

<p><strong>FREE BAR</strong> sponsored by Huddle.net, the unified collaboration platform with a social networking twist. Check out <a href="http://www.huddle.net/developers/">Huddle&rsquo;s API</a>. <a href="http://www.huddle.net/careers">Huddle are hiring</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Startups!</strong> Find developers experienced with a wide range of tools and platforms and from a variety of backgrounds, including major web properties, agencies, startups and freelancing.</p>

<p><strong>Developers!</strong> Meet startups creating interesting new businesses run by cool people with the chance to make a name for yourself as the next Mark Zuckerberg, Matt Mullenwegg or Ev Williams. Our startups have money to pay market rate salaries and many will offer equity.</p>

<p>The evening will have a roughly equal number of developers and founders networking informally.</p>

<p>Some of the skills required/represented:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Python, Django</li>
<li>Ruby, Rails</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>iPhone development</li>
<li>Android</li>
<li>Ajax</li>
<li>HTML/Javascript/CSS</li>
</ol>

<p>Any and all skills welcome. If you are an experienced developer feeling unchallenged or looking for something with big potential, come along. If you&rsquo;re a startup, we&rsquo;ve got the developers you&rsquo;re looking for!</p>
