<p><a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=3422">Netscape goes the way of IE Mac</a>.</p>
<p>Interesting in the context of <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Browser_Wars_II_The_Saga_Continues/25/60181/index.html">Peter Paul Koch&rsquo;s recent Evolt article</a>, which positions the current browser crop in a new war, but also really sad. Netscape were a silly company at times, but they also fought the good fight pretty well down the years.</p>
<p>RIP.</p>
