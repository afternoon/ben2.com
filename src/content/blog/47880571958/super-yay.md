<p>It&rsquo;s an age old bug bear of mine. I have a tabbed browser, but it opens windows for pages from other apps in new windows. Blows.</p>
<p>Never occurred to me that if I told Safari to just open the new pages in the same window it would be bright enough to open them in new tabs. I assumed it would overwrite the current document like IE does. Safari is bright though. SUPER YAY!</p>
<p>That makes me so happy, no more browser window proliferation. Expos√© or no, I really dislike having more than one browser window. Works well with my Vim hack (below) as well.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.inessential.com/">inessential.com</a> for <a href="http://www.inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2668">the tip off</a>.</p>
