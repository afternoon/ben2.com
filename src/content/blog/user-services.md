<p>Lots of users getting confused, new accounts for each post, it&rsquo;s a mess. Hypo needs to help them out more - anything to make their lives easier.</p> Ideas:
<ul>
<li>Password reminder facility, sends to registered email address. This is the key to stopping the multiplying of accounts.</li>
<li>More help. The welcome screen is OK (I wonder if anyone has actually looked at it&hellip;), maybe it needs renaming to &ldquo;HELP!!!&rdquo;. Maybe a help screen that is shown to users after they signup. Jeez it&rsquo;s a long time since I thought about the signup page. Anyways, there should be a help page always available.</li>
<li>Comments. Every page should have a link to allow users to comment on that page (or just generally). Ideally it should gather as much info about the user&rsquo;s setup as possible. E.g. name, email, browser + platform, page they were at, logged in or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also the log entry editing page for this log needs to remember which mood I was in when I posted a message.</p>
