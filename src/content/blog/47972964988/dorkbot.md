<p>I finally got around to going to <a href="http://dorkbot.org/">Dorkbot</a>, after only a year of meaning to. It was cool.</p>
<p>It was held at <a href="http://www.state51.co.uk">State 51</a>, a new media company occupying a disused factory just at the top of Brick Lane, on the fringe of the Shoreditch New Media Mafia Zone. The factory was ace, practically derelict except for signs of workshop-like activities. I was assured that they have proper offices upstairs. If it were me I would be worried that the place was about to collapse.</p>
<p>Apparently they let several artists use the space, hence the workshoppiness. The best bit is that just inside the front door they had a seven-foot black security droid with a single cylon-like red eye. He was only wooden, but I still wanted to escape his gaze pretty sharpish.</p>
<p>I was late so I missed some of the talking, however I saw <a href="http://www.woodeson.co.uk/">Ben Woodeson</a> talking about some of his installation pieces, I saw Alex (of <a href="http://slab.org/">Slab</a> and <a href="http://slub.org/">Slub</a>) perform some really nice IDM with nowt but a bunch of console windows with Perl scripts in them and then I saw James Larsson frying things with old monitors and generally giving advice on handy stuff to do. Christ monitors are dangerous.</p>
<p>Afterwards I got talking to Alex about his sound software. I learned that he has a C synth module running underneath sending stuff straight to the DSP (intense) and a Perl server doing timing. He was also playing samples as well, so I guess his C module is pretty handy. It was written by the other guy in Slub, who I didn&rsquo;t meet. The music he made was excellent and he&rsquo;d obviously spent a while putting it all together. It started sounding like a bunch of random FM synth tones, but it was obviously much more carefully orchestrated than that. I really enjoyed it. I think it&rsquo;s a really cool thing to be doing with your computer and it&rsquo;s yet another thing that I&rsquo;m jealous of. I&rsquo;m such a grass-is-always-greener person.</p>
<p>I saw Peter, a guy from the Dorkbot list who I had an interview with a few weeks ago. After the interview I decided I didn&rsquo;t want the job, but neglected to be polite enough to actually write to him and tell him. Then there he was at the bar, serving beer, so I had no chance of avoiding him. Turns out he didn&rsquo;t really mind. I think he twigged in the interview that I didn&rsquo;t really want to give up freelance that much.</p>
<p>Peter introduced me to <a href="http://paulm.com">Paul Makepeace</a>, another coder (I only know that having been to his site though). We chatted for ages about <a href="http://www.openmoney.org">open money</a>, which he&rsquo;s involved in. Basically open money and similar systems seek to create small community currency systems where the emphasis is much more on using value to encourage co-operation rather than selection in a competitive environment. It&rsquo;s a fascinating subject and I agreed to do some hacking for the community site at some point. I kind of told him that I didn&rsquo;t have much free time, which I feel a bit bad about know, because having read his CV I&rsquo;m quite interested in having a bit more of a chat with him. I may also try and get Charlie involved in some way.</p>
<p>So all in all it was a fascinating and stimulating evening and will definitely, definitely be going again. Next time I will try and take some other people from the gang, particularly Miles.</p>
