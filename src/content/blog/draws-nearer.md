<p>I made a goodbye stencil:</p>
<p><img src="/stuff/journal_src/thesign.jpg" alt="Norwich to London"/></p>
<p>The little red text says &ldquo;Goodbye City Road.&rdquo; The ink ran really badly on the fairly shiny door paint. I should have sanded it quickly first, but never mind.</p>
<p>So today I&rsquo;ve done that and copied all my files off my big storage drive in the server. I need to convert it from ext2 to fat and then insert it into my/Louise&rsquo;s win2k machine, Julia. I&rsquo;ve got 28gb of stuff on that drive and it&rsquo;s taking forever to copy over.</p>
<p>Louise and I have started thinking about packing, not a lot, but a tiny bit. We went in the shed and found a big box and I have used the word &ldquo;packing&rdquo; more than a couple of times. Tomorrow the fun really begins&hellip;</p>
