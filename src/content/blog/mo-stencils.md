<p>I cut me another stencil, it took me hours. I made a grid-based pixel font design in Illustrator and then transferred it by hand to card. The cutting gave me really bad RSI. I super-masked it when spraying, I thought I&rsquo;d put too much paint down and it would drip but it was OK. I chose a particuarly audacious spot on the toilet wall. Right where the men look!</p>
<p>It says &ldquo;COME ON MY SELECTAH!&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll post a picture when I find the software for my camera.</p>
