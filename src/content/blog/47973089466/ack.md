<p>So Hixie blunders on the list and announces that the WG is looking at the centering problems we&rsquo;ve all been fighting about for the last few days!</p>
<p>Obviously this is good news, but I can&rsquo;t help getting the feeling that they just aren&rsquo;t really thinking about the outside world too much. If they were then the argument would have been cancelled with a single line email: &ldquo;In progress after CSS 2.1&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mental note: The W3C is an elephant. It&rsquo;s not going to do anything quickly, stop expecting daily feedback.</p>
