<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s grey and shit. The weather is extremely nasty.</li>
<li>Nobody is talking to me about work. Several people have rung me saying that they want me to do work but <b>nobody</b> can be fucked to ring and say yes, we want you to get paid for working for us. It&rsquo;s been three months since I&rsquo;ve done any work and I&rsquo;m getting very poor now. I&rsquo;m not going to be able to go to Russia unless I do lots of work between now and then, so I haven&rsquo;t turned anything down. I was supposed to start work on one job this week and they haven&rsquo;t even decided if they want it done or not.</li>
<li>The people I live with are useless. Those who said they would come out to Royksopp tonight aren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going on my own now. It won&rsquo;t be too bad as Louise is working there, but still. Also Louise and I spend at least Â£30 a week on food and there is still never anything to fucking eat.</li>
<li>Thom&rsquo;s attitude is annoying me. He doesn&rsquo;t have any money and can&rsquo;t pay his bills. When I ask him for the money he owes me he says he needs to get more shifts at work. Today he blew work off because he wanted to go to the pub. Grrr. In addition, Thom is not the only one pulling this tactic. Everybody owes money, few people are actually working to pay their debts. I&rsquo;m not working either, but I pay my debts (and everybody else&rsquo;s it seems). I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m alone in feeling this, but borrowing money from your friends and then not paying it back is just shit.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, bunch of shit really.</p>
