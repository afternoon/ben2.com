<p>It looks like I&rsquo;m getting into the sensational headline writing. I&rsquo;ve often wondered about putting titles on the messages on Hypothetical but never quite did. I think it adds something to a message, but only when used well and I&rsquo;m not sure quite what it adds even then.</p>
<p>Ah well, you can get a feel of what Hype would be like from this anyway. In the mean time I&rsquo;m trying to work out what should go here and what to Hype. I&rsquo;m also not sure how far I want to go with posting. I need About.com to have a &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve decided to write a weblog&rdquo; tutorial. Sometime maybe.</p>
