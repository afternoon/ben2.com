<p>I was ill. Big cold, fever for a couple of days. Not fully fixed yet, still bunged up. I had to miss my grandfather&rsquo;s funeral because of the need to catch up on work. Grr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/11/12/23428/753">The sun&rsquo;s up to something</a>. Ever since I watched 2010, the solar system sometimes really badly gives me the creeps. Being on Earth is like running and hiding under my duvet. It&rsquo;s no help at all, but at least I&rsquo;m not suspended in the cold nothing staring at a sun that is trillions and trillions times bigger than me and pissed off.</p>
