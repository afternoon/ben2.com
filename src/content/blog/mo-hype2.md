<p>Page containers don&rsquo;t have to be anything more than another HTML template. PHP variables can be used that write in groups of portlets and the main page content. A theme would consist of a page template and a portlet template. That way they could be powerful enough to allow people complete control of the site image, tidily destroying the whole ultra-grid structure.</p>
<p>Another handy thing would be to have a default theme, probably kurish, with lots more PHP in. The PHP would allow the theme to access a user record dictating cell colours and such. These fields can be set from a simple theme wizard, accessible from the profile page. An expert theme page could just consist of two textarea&rsquo;s. Expert themes can go on the list&hellip; but that might need censoring.</p>
