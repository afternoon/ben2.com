<p>I think I&rsquo;ve written about <a href="http://www.proce55ing.net">Proce55ing</a> before. It&rsquo;s a cool little Java tool for making graphics applets really easily. It&rsquo;s a veneer over Java&rsquo;s own graphics functionality (and other stuff, sound, networking), but an extremely fun and useful one. Kind of like Flash in a way, but more programmery. It&rsquo;s a great piece of software, it makes it fun to play in code.</p>
<p>Today I messed around with the 3D functions. They&rsquo;re pretty basic, but they&rsquo;re extremely simple to use. I realised that if I&rsquo;d taken the time to write myself a library of simple rotateY, translate, etc. functions, like p5 has, I would have had a much easier time with 3D. It&rsquo;s always been the maths that raise the entry price too high, so I should have done it once and left it behind me. Being able to visualise the operations I&rsquo;m doing by way of outputting them as cubes has also increased my understanding of the maths as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, I made some nice vector 3D stuff, will show it off when the time comes. Nothing new has gone into the content section for a while.</p>
