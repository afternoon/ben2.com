<p>Code software or sit on a plane.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing both, of course, I&rsquo;ve been hacking like a demon for the last seventeen hours and my five hour flight starts in nine hours time.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve pretty much finished <a href="http://underwired.cc">Underwired.cc</a>, despite the fact that the point is moot thanks to my imminent departure. I do hope that it holds its own while I&rsquo;m away, although I&rsquo;m sure there will be a big list of issues waiting for me when I land on the 27th. I&rsquo;m quite proud to be finished, 5,799 lines at the end of it all and dang! I&rsquo;m tired.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very excited about going to New York. And slightly worried that I might be letting myself in for some quite serious DVT with all this sitting still. Must jog around Heathrow&hellip;</p>
