<p>I bought <a href="http://ben2.com">ben2.com</a> for my work. Explaining how to spell A-F-T-N-N.org over the phone to clients was getting dull. Plus, I did feel a bit bad for putting commercial stuff into the .org domain. No biggie, just I&rsquo;d prefer not to. Now I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Now I have to pry the work and the non-work parts of this site apart. Expect most of the <a href="/about/">about section</a> to move to ben2.</p>
