<p>I think social software ain&rsquo;t all that or a bag of potato chips. <a href="http://www.headshift.com/archives/001018.cfm">Allegedly</a> the toast of <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETCON</a> and, like, the biggest thing ever, I&rsquo;m not totally convinced.</p>
<p>Social software is software, mostly websites, that allow people to hang out and stuff. It&rsquo;s the first round that hasn&rsquo;t convinced me: <a href="http://tribes.net/">tribes.net</a>, <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> and so on. In reality, the term is ridiculously broad, covering loads of different potential application areas. It&rsquo;s not even something new either. I guess it&rsquo;s just a camel&rsquo;s back accident, suddenly it&rsquo;s moved out of the core and gone overground within the startups. I consider myself just outside of that sphere, so the fact that I&rsquo;m talking about it now says something. That I developed a <a href="http://hypothetical.co.uk">stoopid simple piece of social software</a> three years ago is a random connection really. That I&rsquo;m rewriting it now with some urgency says more.</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/12/24.html#a488">interesting blog post</a> via <a href="http://raindrop.msresearch.us/">Microsoft Research</a> of all places, which discusses some of the problems. What use are systems which provide tools to communicate with everybody you knew ever? It&rsquo;s like the Christmas mail-merge newsletter, or the village notice board that nobody reads. I don&rsquo;t believe people can really have 300 friends. Rael Dornfest has <a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2003/12/24.html#a488">115 people in his AIM buddy list</a>, how often does he communicate with each of them?</p>
<p>Hanging out on Hype for so long nips any potential desire to join a friend site like tribes in the bud immediately. I have have joined tribes, just to see what&rsquo;s up, and I&rsquo;m not really impressed to be honest. Not that I&rsquo;ve really given it much time. In my limited bit of exploration, I failed to see anything that really puts it head and shoulders above your run -of-the-mill forum site. Particularly, it seems that the main axis of group activity centers around subjects again. I haven&rsquo;t built my own tribe, maybe I should just to see. Everything else up there is on my desktop - email, calendar and so on. I already have ways of controlling and sharing those content blobs and they&rsquo;re things that not really all that social softwarey IMHO.</p>
<p>My thing with Hype at the moment is that the axis of group activity should not be a specific subject, but just group background noise. There&rsquo;s enough of that and that&rsquo;s what makes me use Hype. I get a regular feed of hacking, news, links, games, events, blog-like experience entries and many other types of content. I don&rsquo;t actually visit many other blog like sites on a regular basis, Slashdot and recently boingboing, but that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;ve no need to stray outside my group.</p>
<p>So I think everybody will be up for that. I&rsquo;m hoping to attract people who aren&rsquo;t necessarily so net literate. I think a lot of heavy net users have shoehorned their community fix into comments on blogs, forums and other similar but slightly wrong-headed systems. People who are new will hopefully find Hypothetical easy to use and basically addictive in the way that I do. The test is my 17-year-old sister. If I can get her and her friends to use it, I&rsquo;m in business.</p>
