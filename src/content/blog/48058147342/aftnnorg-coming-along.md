<p>I&rsquo;ve made some additions to this site. I&rsquo;ve built a menu page for the <a href="/content/">content section</a> and added two basic content items: <a href="/content/redworld/">redworld</a> and <a href="/content/swatches/">swatches</a>. Redworld is a PSD I did a while back. I quite like it. Swatches is just an exercise in the use of loops. It merely displays all the colours of the web palette and a random strapline I made up. It&rsquo;s visually quite nice though, and at least nods in the direction of generative art. I cunningly used some absolutely placed headings of different colours to create a neat drop shadow effect. All hail me!</p>
<p>Adding content really highlights the usefulness of the bread crumb trail bit. It&rsquo;s a sweet navigational tool and the fact that it can be found in the same place in every page on the site except the home and error pages should make it invaluable.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to make some more stuff. Maybe I&rsquo;ll kill the last few things on the journal to-do list, maybe I&rsquo;ll make a homepage. Who knows&hellip;</p>
