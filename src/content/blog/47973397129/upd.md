<p><a href="http://chinese-music.dsi.internet2.edu/">Chinese music archive</a>, has MP3&rsquo;s and AU&rsquo;s. I want to use some of these sounds in Live to make crossover sino-electro madness.</p>
<p>Since last posting I went to a wicked party and DJ&rsquo;d with three turntables and my laptop using Live. It was cool, if a bit too experimental.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also upgraded Fortyfive (our firewall/NAT machine) to use a much better interface to the ADSL modem. No more kernel panics! Phew. Currently I&rsquo;m upgrading to Debian 3, which is twatting my internet radio MP3 listening rather badly.</p>
