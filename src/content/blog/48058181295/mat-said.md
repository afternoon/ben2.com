<p>That he never visits any of the pages except the front one. Thus we could say the features outside that main page are not useful or not known of. That happened to Chon who wanted the archive but couldn&rsquo;t see the button for the pixels. One useful addition in this vein would be more buttons actually on the portlets. A delete button to match the edit on messages for logged in users would provide greater immediacy. Something similar to the &hellip;bizniss portlet can provide shortcuts to most used profile options (theme), serialising messages is the lazy man&rsquo;s archive. Many of the improvements to Hype that I&rsquo;ve talked about are aimed at more potent techniques for users to organise information, things like proper threads and replies and comments allow people to naturally group stuff together (and get&rsquo;s round the bolding names for replies bizniss.</p>
<p>As well as having section pages, like exactly those that the forum lacks, each function set could be corralled into a portlet, to provide the same access from the front page and to grab advertising space on that page. <b>Bingo!</b></p>
<p>Hey, people use the mail page though. That could do with some improvement, attachments would be cool.</p>
