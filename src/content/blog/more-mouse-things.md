<p>Or cheese, as Tom suggested.</p>
<p>My original aim was to begin work on something of sufficient quality to submit to the Flash contest running on <a href="http://www.redism.com/">redism.com</a>. It&rsquo;s a corporate sponsored site, but it&rsquo;s run by Underwired and so I thought I&rsquo;d chip in. I wanted to go down the generative/interactive route that I&rsquo;ve been heading towards for a while. So, trusty copy of Maeda in hand, I booted Flash.</p>
<p>I got quite a lot done, several different pieces. They&rsquo;re all fairly basic underneath but each successive piece is visually more impressive. I&rsquo;ve put the lot up as a section in content called <a href="/content/onenight/">OneNightOfFlash</a>. I&rsquo;m just on a Flash roll at the moment. Although I still don&rsquo;t have my submission, I&rsquo;m well chuffed with what I&rsquo;ve acheived tonight and I&rsquo;m hopeful that I will get a chance to sort out a more sophisticated, finalised piece by Friday.</p>
