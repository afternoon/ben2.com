<p>Found another quality Soho record shop today, again on Berwick Street, it&rsquo;s called Koobla. Berwick Street is vinyl mecca. I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it. So many electro sections, so little time!</p>
<p>Anyway, I picked up a new Shut Up and Dance single, <em>Supernova</em>, with characteristically rough bass action. Also a Radioactive Man single and an album. Haven&rsquo;t checked out the album yet, but the single, some remixes of <em>Wrecked</em>, also contains potentially dangerous basslines, particularly the <em>&lsquo;ave That</em> mix by Tim Wright.</p>
