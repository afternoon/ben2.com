<p>Went along to <a href="http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2006/04/02/meetup">London 2.0</a> last night, a monthly meetup of nerds with a web flavour. I met <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon Willison</a> of Django and Yahoo! again, he was the guy got me started on Django, we talked about the sad state of Yahoo! UK. I met <a href="http://holovaty.com/">Adrian Holovaty</a>, also of Django, and discussed magic removal briefly and possible routes for a transamerican road trip. It was Adrian&rsquo;s first trip outside the US. I felt sorry for him doing it as a fly by night work trip. I met Edward (didn&rsquo;t get his surname), a hacker at ITN and another UEA alumnus. A few years younger than me, I couldn&rsquo;t think of any common friends we might have, and we neglected to bad mouth the professors for some reason. I met <a href="http://phildawes.net/blog/">Phil Dawes</a>, a programmer at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, some guys from ThoughtWorks, including the guy responsible for <a href="http://weblog.greenpeace.org/melt/">Custard</a>, Remi Delon, the original author of <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a> and a few other people whose names and associations escaped me. Towards the end of the night we shrunk down into one group and had an edifying if slightly bravado-fuelled discussion about performance traits of Ruby and Rails.</p>
