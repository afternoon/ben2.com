<p>I have been reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/034537410X/glance/103-8692864-0294245">Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming</a> by Stephen LaBerge and Howard Rheingold. LaBerge is apparently the head honcho of lucid dreamers and the book is quite interesting. The first few chapters have instructed me to log my dreams in order to find patterns. Recognising these patterns whilst dreaming, combined with a few other exercises, whill hopefully induce lucidity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not effective to only post my dreams to this log. By the time my machine boots I will have forgotten. However, I intend to note them and then post them later for posterity.</p>
<p>So here goes&hellip; BTW feel free to post comments on my dreams or your own dreams, could be interesting.</p>
