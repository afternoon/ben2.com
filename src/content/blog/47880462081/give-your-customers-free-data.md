<p><a href="http://www.mobile-weblog.com/50226711/vodafone_allows_data_billing.php">The Mobile Weblog reports</a> that Vodafone have introduced a kind of &ldquo;0800 for data&rdquo; service, allowing companies to sponsor the cost of accessing their services. This opens the door for some smart cookies (Google, I&rsquo;m looking at you) to find the money from other sources, such as advertising, and get more customers involved. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to choose between the similar services of Google and Yahoo! if one is willing to cover my data charges for me.</p>
