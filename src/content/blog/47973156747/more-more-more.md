<p>In addition to the list of stuff from last night. I think it&rsquo;s worth saying that CSS is a tricky bugger and making it easier might mean more people would adopt it. Also, I think that new syntax would be better than garbling the old. For example, it might be possible to expand the box model to allow absolutely positioned blocks to affect the flow of their containing blocks, but then 100% of browsers would be breaking the standard, rather than leaving some part of it out.</p>
<p>Also I&rsquo;ve been wondering about a property for the grid called <code>folding</code> which somehow explains to the browser what it&rsquo;s supposed to do when it&rsquo;s narrower than the <code>min-width</code> of the grid (as defined by the contents if necessary) or indeed shorter than the min-height. This property might be a list of indices to sub-blocks or IDs, in order, which explains to the browser the order of the content so it remains readable. Of course the order of the content is generally the order of the elements in the HTML&hellip; hmmm. I have little idea how this might function. I&rsquo;m just throwing it out there. It might turn out to be easier to leave the adapting to small browsers to media queries.</p>
