<p>I just spoke to Lateral, they aren&rsquo;t going to hire me. At least, almost certainly not. As I suspected they felt that I was mainly a developer and that the position they were recruiting for was much more one of day to day administration. Loz, the guy who I spoke to, put it best saying there is a strong chance that six months down the line I may well be frustrated and that would be a bad situation for both them and me. It&rsquo;s a bit confused, they&rsquo;re going to keep the post open and see if anyone better comes along, so it may be that they contact me in the future. Likewise if they find themselves more in need of a developer.</p>
<p>As you might be able to tell I&rsquo;m not really that gutted. It would have been good, but I don&rsquo;t want to be doing admin for the next year, it would bore me eventually and is contrary to where I want to go in the future. I&rsquo;m looking at it as an opportunity. The project I (hopefully) have lined up for April will allow me to develop my skills as a programmer and put the word Java into my CV a few more times and after that, who knows!</p>
