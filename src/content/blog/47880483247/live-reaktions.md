<p>Moblog are running a competition &ldquo;<a href="http://http://www.thesoundtracktoyourlife.com/">The soundtrack to your life</a>&rdquo; in conjunction with Sony Ericsson. It&rsquo;s a musical theme to promote the sexay W800i walkman phone. I entered a piece of what might be broadly termed photojournalism. I went to my favourite record shop, Rough Trade, and to a crazy shop that sells synths and music production tech and interviewed the people there, chatted about music and then pulled it all together into a brief piece exploring my interaction with music. You can find the entry split into four parts on the site: <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=96784">1</a>, <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=%2096786">2</a>, <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=%2096788">3</a>, <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/view.php?id=%2096789">4</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the piece I talked about music making with Live, Reason and Max. I felt I needed something to do with my suddenly moderately sized pool of free time (work is slim since I went away for 2 weeks and came back), aside that is from writing an automatic-illustrating programme, playing chess, mixing, riding my bike around London and reading Gödel Escher Bach. So over the weekend I watched a few of <a href="http://www.ableton.com/index.php?main=movies">Ableton&rsquo;s Live videos</a> and played around connecting Reason and Live via Rewire and MIDI. It was cool and I managed to make some fairly cool stuff, nothing special, just an improvement on the music I&rsquo;ve created so far. Live allows you to record MIDI snapshots and tinker with them really quickly. You can be in the mix and say I want a little off-beat melody here and just play one in, quantize it and set it going. It makes it very easy to express music as it develops in your head. I find myself tapping or humming companion melodies and rhythms as I listen to tracks, I can use that to my advantage.</p>

<p>Then I downloaded a Reaktor 5 demo. Damn that is the sweetest piece of software ever. I don&rsquo;t understand it at all really, only in a superficial way, but it&rsquo;s so cool. Just the demo instruments and ensembles hint at a world of such great coolness that it makes me drool almost. I want to dedicate my life to it, like some kind of Reaktor-monk, shut away in a mountain monastery with just my laptop and that one piece of software.</p>

<p>But my main problem still is not my understanding of or ability with the software, but my lack of basic musical skills. I have been thinking that the way to resolve this is to just learn to play the piano. The idea being that by playing other people&rsquo;s music I can bridge the gap between tune in my head and how that tune is played. Transforming the musical portions of my brain into a recordable form. So I&rsquo;ve been contemplating splashing out on a nice MIDI/USB keyboard. But would I ever actually play it, or would I just go back to my Gamecube, or reading, or Illustrant (illustration generator program)? It&rsquo;s £65 for the keyboard I&rsquo;ve got my eye on, so it&rsquo;s enough to make me weigh the decision carefully.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is advance my musical &ldquo;career&rdquo;. Start gigging, probably at the Foundry again, get in with other musicians. I&rsquo;d really like to collaborate and share ideas, but at the moment it would be embarrassing! I&rsquo;d just like to produce good music and share it really.</p>
