<p>In my last mail to the list I asked the spec people to comment. <a href="http://hixie.ch/">Ian Hickson</a> (AKA Hixie) of Mozilla did. Hixie is one of the specifications group and standards QA for Netscape. He&rsquo;s also an implementor and is really one of the browser big guns right now. However, he said nothing more than that CSS has tables, a cop out!</p>
<p>Tables are good for some things, but in complicated layouts they get nasty. Now we have CSS, but we have the same situation. It&rsquo;s good, but decent layouts are too complicated to build. A rock! A hard place! Which way to turn? In the last year I&rsquo;ve solved most problems by using both systems, which is silly and rapidly going out of date.</p>
