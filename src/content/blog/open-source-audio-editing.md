<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/guides/tweaks/linux-audio.ars">Interesting Ars Technica review of OSS audio editing software</a>. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> on OS X as my only wave editor for a while and it&rsquo;s at least as good as the limited selection of commercial editors I&rsquo;ve played with. It&rsquo;s very stable which is the nice thing. After reading the article I think I&rsquo;ll have to check out Ardour and SND some time, though Ardour is X11 on OS X which is annoying.</p>
