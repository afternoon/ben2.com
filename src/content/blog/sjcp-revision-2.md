<p>I found an excellent set of <a href="http://www.janeg.ca/java2.html">study notes for the SCJP exam</a>. They are very comprehensive. Every Java programmer should read them really, it helps to know everything about the language you&rsquo;re coding in, it may be able to do some things that will really help your code.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this set of notes is that each section has a couple of tips and traps to watch out for, <a href="http://www.janeg.ca/scjp/tips.html">here&rsquo;s the full set</a>.</p>
