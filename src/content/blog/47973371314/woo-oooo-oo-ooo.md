<p>Christmas has been excellent. We had Louise&rsquo;s parents and sister for the day. We did the dinner, although I did wuss out, letting Louise and her Father do most of the work. I did Chesnut parcels for Louise (being vegetarian) and they came out very well, apparently. Anyway, the food was good enough to precipitate an afternoon of sleeping and TV watching.</p>
<p>Presents-wise, Louise bought me a fucking Gamecube! I could not believe it and my face clearly spelled out my surprise to everyone there! It is the best present ever, measured as a function of Louise&rsquo;s cashflow divided by the cost of the item multiplied by the quality of the secret-keeping.</p>
<p>Today (Boxing Day) has been really chilled, Louise and I wandered and watched TV. Tomorrow, my Father&rsquo;s third wedding! It will be a very low key affair, Louise and I are in many minds as to what to wear.</p>
