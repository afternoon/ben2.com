<p>Louise and I planted some window boxes and put them on our lesser balcony. My Mum gave us some really nice terracotta pots and we bought plants, seeds and compost today. Being in the garden centre was a bit freaky, but I managed to not flip and run away. We have Lettuce, Rocket, Chives, Parsley, Mint, Basil, Lavender and some Cornflowers. The Chives, Parsley, Mint and Basil were bought as plants so we can eat those straight away, but we&rsquo;ll have to wait a month or so for the others to do their thing. Apparently Rocket just grows like a bastard. You pick it every couple of days and it just keeps coming back. Louise and I couldn&rsquo;t really grow too much salad, we both love eating it. We were also really tempted by bigger vegetables but we don&rsquo;t have the resources. If we manage to grow a steady supply of herbs that would be cool. I just have to get into the habit of cooking with them now.</p>
