<p>I just had to add a load of code which wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in the manual. I found it all in Apple&rsquo;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Graphics_3D/Cocoa_InitGL.htm">Cocoa_InitGL</a> sample. I wrote my first Cocoa app! Woo! Now I want get it to dump the rendered scene to a file. With the old Windoze version I would just hit print screen and paste the image into Photoshop. I&rsquo;m determined not to go that route this time.</p>
