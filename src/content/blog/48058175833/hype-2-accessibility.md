<p>The WAI Priority 1 guidelines are easy. The second and third sets require some thought, but come with nice badges. Hype 2 could have badges: BSD, PHP, MySQL, WAI and other W3C standards. Maybe a badges page and then I could really go to town ;-)</p>
<p>WAI-AA decries auto-refreshing pages, because it can&rsquo;t be stopped. This is understandable, what if you are half way down the page reading when it refreshes? Instead I reckon a new message reminder, something that appears at the top of the page to indicate new messages. This would cause a reflow, but perhaps just a visbility: hidden will do. It also bans pop-ups but I&rsquo;m gonna defy that, it bans them based on their being an annoyance or a distraction, Hype&rsquo;s will be functional. However, this is more javascript. Hype 2 relies on full javascript capability, handily this is about the best supported out of the enhanced HTML techs, IMHO, never the less it will mean having a non-JS version on standby for the text-mode people and those who believe Javascript can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most important accessibility features relate to readability. Font sizes especially should be flexible, the 1-7 HTML scheme is good, better (maybe) is configuration of font sizes in the profile.</p>
<p>Here are some other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>TOC or site map, perhaps combined with the help texts</li>
<li>More header metadata (i.e. some)</li>
<li>&ldquo;13.4 Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;6.4 For scripts and applets, ensure that event handlers are input device-independent.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard. The text only version should be at least AA, hopefully nearer AAA quality accessibility, and I think the main version should be Aa (Priority 1.5).</p>
