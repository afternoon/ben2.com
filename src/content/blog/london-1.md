<p>I forgot to do this yesterday, my one year in London post. We are now half way through our two year contract on the flat.</p>
<p>I still like it.</p>
<p>I just feel like I haven&rsquo;t really sampled enough of it yet. I guess you never can, but I feel like there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff that I could have been doing and instead I&rsquo;ve been sat inside trying to work but prevaricating instead. As I am now in fact.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also a bit sad that I haven&rsquo;t made any new friends here. There&rsquo;s Louise and Tom, JC, Adam and Charlie. Al is around. I don&rsquo;t really know him, but I reckon we&rsquo;ll get together for beer at some point. Each of those people has friends and work colleagues here, so they&rsquo;re OK. I&rsquo;ve met quite a few of these friends and colleagues and many of them were cool, but none of them are the kind of people I would be really good friends with. Because I work from home I haven&rsquo;t got a line to work people. At Soup I really got along with all the people I worked with and I&rsquo;d like to have that again. Albeit without the 9-5.</p>
<p>So, solutions.</p>
<p>First of all I need to go out more, tag along with other people on what they&rsquo;re doing, rather than setting up stuff myself. There&rsquo;s only ever a very small crowd at stuff I arrange. I also need to go to more internet-organised stuff, such as Dorkbot. The sort-of-party that Furtherfield held that I went to was pretty good and I did meet some pretty cool people there. I&rsquo;d like to work with Furtherfield at some point, but I think we&rsquo;ve both just got too much other stuff to be doing before we can collaborate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been thinking about finding a shared office to join in on or something. <a href="http://www.nmk.co.uk/nmk/default.cfm">New Media Knowledge</a> run one up in Harrow, but that&rsquo;s a bit far to be going each day. Plus they don&rsquo;t return my emails asking for pricing. I&rsquo;ll have to keep looking on that front, but I think that shared offices are a bit of a neat idea that haven&rsquo;t really caught on yet.</p>
