<p>An unexpected turn. Last night I sent a rant to <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">ALA</a> and <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">WaSP</a> fame. The man is one of the gurus of web hacking and for some reason I felt like he might hear my plaintive call. Amazingly, he did. He told me that if I wanted to write an article about all this for ALA, he would consider publishing it. ALA has a readership of about 65,000 people a week!</p>
<p>First of all, <em style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">wow</em>! Secondly this, and other feedback I&rsquo;ve had today, has put my activity so far into perspective a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become way too passionate about it. I need to chill. I feel bad about the ranting and I apologise to all who bore the fury, particularly Eric Meyer. Who I actually also got a message from today, but it was just to tell me not to include replies in my messages to his <a href="http://www.css-discuss.org/">css-discuss</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps dropping in and heckling the authors of CSS was not the best way to go about this. I was expecting them to enter into a discussion a bit more, but I guess that&rsquo;s a bit idealistic. Writing an article for ALA is the ideal next step. It will give me a forum to air my ideas and put them up for peer review. Hopefully I will be able to refine feedback from that article and other channels into an actual proposal. If I can&rsquo;t get the article on to ALA, then I guess I should just shut up.</p>
<p>I really should read more as well. Theres a lot left undiscovered in www-style archives. Zeldman has written a good many articles about web design that I haven&rsquo;t read and should. My argument will (and should) sink like a rock if I retread old ground, or fail to see the obvious.</p>
