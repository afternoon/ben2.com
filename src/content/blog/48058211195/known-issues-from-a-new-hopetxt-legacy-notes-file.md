<h3>General</h3>
as a cure for both security and cookie setting, go for PHP sessions and keep all hypo-data on the server (db?)<br/>
page expiry date should be set to time of last message (cunning 4 caching)<br/>
review caching stuff thoroughly, cos it&rsquo;s shit (is it required at all?)<br/>
add target=&ldquo;_blank&rdquo; to all off-site urls<br/>
try and find a workaround for very long &ldquo;words&rdquo;<br/>
I am lame and have forgotten my password, please de-lame me via my email address<br/>
how are you going to fix that nasty bug in the message summary code where you split the message halfway through a tag? eh?<br/>
cut admin/archive/profile to given number of messages, set by user in profile<br/>
2cols lpage situation needs CHECKING, complex one that<br/>
login failed screen offers chance to be mailed your password<br/>
Crazy REGEX generation time is NEAR!<br/>
more user fields: description, tea grade, general courtesy personalisation stuff<br/>
check for odd numbers of quotes in posts, as this really fucks the browser over<br/>
more functions!!<br/>
image gallery<br/>
microsites box - links to other hypothetical network content.

<h3>Threads</h3>
<p>new fields: parent thread, public/private, aggregation yes/no, write userlist<br/>
thread owners can set read and write user lists and kick messages to other threads (maybe only parent)<br/>
whole gamut of thread management tools in admin page, tools for thread owners in profile page (&ldquo;Your threads&rdquo;)<br/>
user levels for creating threads?<br/>
editthread.php: parent thread select box, public check box, aggregate check,
	+ a whole set of checks for setting up user read + write lists</p>

<h3>WAP</h3>
<p>Number of messages, rather than chronological period. Homepage more like archive<br/>
Logging in, posting messages most urgent.<br/>
when CENSORING for FILESIZE, always provide a link to next content group</p>
<p>and anything posted in messages and everything in the Yet to come&hellip; box</p>
