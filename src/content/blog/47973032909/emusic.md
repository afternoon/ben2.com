<p>I joined <a href="http://emusic.com">Emusic</a> today. I&rsquo;ve had well over a gigabyte off them already. It&rsquo;s ten bucks a month if you sign up for 12 months. The selection is not perfect, but it&rsquo;s always going to be bringing in a stream of new music and it is getting better. They have enough stuff in the genres I like for me to be very happy (I&rsquo;m particularly happy with the large amount of <a href="http://www.mille-plateaux.net/mp/">Mille Plateaux</a> material available). Sure I&rsquo;d like more Aphex Twin and Wu Tang Clan, but I just can&rsquo;t get it so never mind. <a href="http://aasearch.emusic.com/aasearch?rtype=search_art&amp;searchterm=dj+assault&amp;imageField.x=0&amp;imageField.y=0&amp;cid=emusic">DJ Assault</a> it is.</p>
