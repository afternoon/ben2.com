<p>Having just mentioned <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>, I decided to use their DB_Pager class to split this weblog up into chunks and make the page a bit more useable. It&rsquo;s really sweet. It means using the DB abstraction class as well, but that&rsquo;s no problem. I get to use cool DSN URLs like mysql://monkey@hype/etc. All of the navigation at the bottom of the page (and more, which I tried but didn&rsquo;t keep) is provided by DB_Pager. The whole thing was fantastically easy. So easy in fact that I could be bothered to wade through some of the hellish tables I&rsquo;ve used here. Why the hell didn&rsquo;t I write it with CSS?</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s all going to change soon, I need an URL to give to potential clients and that URL needs to be slightly more than a dodgy weblog.</p>
