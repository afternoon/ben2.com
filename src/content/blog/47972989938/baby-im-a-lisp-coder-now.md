<p class="eg"><code>
(princ '|What is your name? |)<br/>
(setq a (read))<br/>
(princ '|Hello |)<br/>
(princ a)<br/>
(princ '|!|)
</code></p>
<p>This program asks you your name and then says hello to you! I learnt how to do conditionals and define functions (yes, even recursive ones) too, but I&rsquo;m officially worn out. I&rsquo;m retreating to infix notation post haste!</p>
