<p>In order to be a good website, you need:</p>
<p class="eg">
<b>H</b>igh-quality content.<br/>
<b>O</b>ften updated<br/>
<b>M</b>inimal download time<br/>
<b>E</b>ase of use</p>
<p>And, to be superb:</p>
<p class="eg">
<b>R</b>elevant to users&rsquo; needs<br/>
<b>U</b>nique to the online medium<br/>
<b>N</b>et-centric corporate culture</p>
<p>Also, a user gets bored of waiting in ten seconds. For a page to download in this time it must weight less that 34kb (150-200kb for DSL). In order for a user to completely feel in charge the page needs to download in less than a second (!). For a modem that means 2k, 8k for ADSL/ISDN or 100k for T1. I guess that for an ethernet intranet that means a page can be about a meg before it takes longer than a second to get moved across the network. However, on the intranet it is the response time of the server that makes the critical difference. Fortyfive (our PPro 180 server) is never going to acheive this with dynamic content, but for HTML is no problem.</p>
