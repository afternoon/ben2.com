<p>In Part XVIIII of Afternoon Attacks the Web Community with a Cudgel, I pick on designer and writer <a href="http://www.lab404.com">Curt Cloninger</a>. Curt is the author of the excellent <a href="http://www.lab404.com/dan/">Fresh Styles for Web Designers</a>, the only book on web design I own.</p>
<p>I explained my crusade, albeit not very well, and he had some interesting points to make, not least this:</p>
<blockquote><p>So why, if I&rsquo;m doing a design-centric, low-text site, do I care about being standards compliant?  The standards aren&rsquo;t made to accomodate the kind of work I&rsquo;m doing anyway, and they never will be.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just think of standards as the walls of the room I&rsquo;m in, whereas of course it&rsquo;s actually the browser implementations of those standards that make up the walls. I disagree though, standards are important to every developer because the web is young and imperfect medium and it&rsquo;s the standards that are going to push it forwards. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m concerned in many ways, because I see the web being pushed forward with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0303a.shtml#ap1503">semantic purity</a>, accessibility and <a href="http://useit.com">usability</a> the only goals, engendering a rather dull, almost Victorian, experience totally in contrast to our &ldquo;everybody&rsquo;s having sex right now but you!&rdquo; OTT culture.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed is that Curt mentioned the whole Tim Berners-Lee High Energy Physics thing. Everybody, no matter which team their on, mentions this. Strange. I have been thinking anyway that my idea to start the ALA article out with a bit of history is probably redundant since everybody knows it already. I&rsquo;m getting less sure about my article day by day. What am I actually saying?</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS really great, mainly</li>
<li>Tables bad, complicated, old, semantically useless</li>
<li>Web design hard, medium has little control, people (esp. clients) demand faithful reproduction</li>
<li>Fluidity is one of the keys to success, allows people to do cool things like bump their text sizes or turn off images or resize their browser to 1 pixel square whilst retaining perfect layout</li>
<li>Overall, tables better at fluidity than CSS</li>
<li>But tables bad</li>
<li>
<p>Need new thing!</p>
<ul>
<li>Is fluid</li>
<li>Predictable</li>
<li>Easy to use, painless for as many layouts as possible</li>
<li>Good for both coders and DW-monkeys</li>
<li>Complimentary to and logically consistent with rest of CSS</li>
<li>Similar to tables for reasons of application and implementation</li>
<li>Contains advanced syntax for specifying how the layout adapts to different devices or browsers</li>
<li>Allows author to specify ways for things to change</li>
<li>Allows author to know the frame of reference so they can always do something cool with it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Curt also pointed me in the direction of the <a href="http://alistapart.com/stories/dao">Dao of Web Design</a>, a really good ALA article about living on the web, building pages that are flexible and that work for people. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve been making this clear when I&rsquo;ve been hassling people, I certainly didn&rsquo;t make it clear when I wrote to Curt, but this is the big thing for me. Pages have to fit the end browser, in terms of size, font, everything, that&rsquo;s got to be the way it is and that&rsquo;s where CSS is lacking IMHO. Grids aren&rsquo;t great for this, which is why they should be able to reconfigure intelligently. Though working out a syntax to express all this is probably an NP-complete problem. The more I think about this, the more I think I should have been doing this five years ago, when I said I would do something similar for my degree final project and then smoked a bunch of weed instead. This is the kind of thing that would be a cool PhD.</p>
