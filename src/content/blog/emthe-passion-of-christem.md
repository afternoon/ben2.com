<p>Dull and self-indulgent. No character development, no plot. An hour and a half of highly graphic punishment of the man with extremely little to justify it. If there&rsquo;s a good thing about this film it&rsquo;s that it will hopefully  precipitate a rerelease of <em>The Life of Brian</em>, an infinitely superior film.</p>
<p>Really, it was just a waste of my time. Don&rsquo;t bother, even to satisfy your curiosity, it&rsquo;s really just tasteless. Good thing I didn&rsquo;t pay to see it.</p>
