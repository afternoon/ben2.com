<p>What with link click-throughs now being tracked on the Hype home page and soon to be tracked on other pages the autolinks mini-site is kind of redundant. That makes me think about the way that links are scored in general. Links are not going to have their scores demoted all that much anymore. Maybe they should start lower and climb more slowly.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hypothetical needs an Autolinks portlet and any page that deals with messages needs to run mark_links().</p>
