<p>Louise and I went to St Petersburg. It was pretty interesting to see what Russia is like these days, pounded by Tsars and communists, and finally starting to get some freedom, though of a limited sort. They love Putin, he&rsquo;s increased salaries by 10x on average. I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/afternoon/sets/72157602373892820/">some pictures</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also started using Intense Debate, a 3rd party comment system which allows OpenID and should prevent spam a bit more. I may not stick with it, but I&rsquo;ve been trying to find time to build an OpenID-powered comments system for a year now and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s going to happen any time soon! This is an excellent stop-gap.</p>
