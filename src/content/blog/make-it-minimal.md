<p>Been making it minimal with Live recently. The stimulus was to send a mix CD to <a href="http://www.minimallondon.com">minimallondon</a>, but of course it would be a shame not to spread the love a bit further.</p>
<p><a href="http://aftnn.org/stuff/music/afternoon_-_make_it_minimal.mp3">Download Make It Minimal mix</a> (MP3).</p>
<p>Music includes a few bits off Marc Houle&rsquo;s new <em>Bay Of Figs</em> LP, Troy Pierce, a bunch of Audion/Matthew Dear, Afternoon Coffee Boys, Plastikman/Hawtin, of course, Andre Kraml and a bunch of others.</p>
