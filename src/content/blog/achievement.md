<p>I swam 1500m today, with stops every 300m. It took nearly an hour and a half, so whilst I can sprint at a good 3km/h, I can only maintain a pace of 1km/h and probably not for much longer than an hour and a half.</p>
<p>I found a place in Fulham that sells running shoes and actually bothers to fit them so I don&rsquo;t kill my feet. I may well head down there tomorrow and check it out. I might end up running more than swimming because I don&rsquo;t have to spend ages dechlorinating my hair afterwards. Plus I&rsquo;m more likely to just speed out for half an hour than go for a swim as when I pay to get into the pool I like to stay for a while. Running and then going into the pool sounds pretty good though.</p>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s ex-personal trainer friend the lovely Megan says that I could burn off my relatively small beer gut by doing 20 minutes proper exercise three times a week. I don&rsquo;t care that much about the podge. I&rsquo;m more concious that as I get older it&rsquo;s more important to be in the habit of being proactive about  exercise. As I&rsquo;m freelance, I have to plan it into my day or I start getting fidgety.</p>
