<p>One word: riff. I&rsquo;ve been listening to Elephant today, it&rsquo;s the first guitar record I&rsquo;ve liked in a couple of years. It combines so many good things effortlessly, the New York Dolls, a nod in the direction of Iggy Pop, a raucous scream of Jon Spencer, almost through to Nick Drake. Seven Nation Army is an army of itself, at first I thought that was why I had the album, but on second listen the rest of it is a good whole. When isn&rsquo;t second listen still a voyage of discovery? I should learn. I&rsquo;m particularly liking the Exploding Blues Geetar Squuuueeelllllslsllslaaaaa. Rockin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I listen to this record in isolation of all other NYC indie rock records, except for the obvious mortal kombat with The Strokes, but I think it&rsquo;s quality. Stroke-comparisons are totally superficial as well, the Stripes are a much deeper band.</p>
