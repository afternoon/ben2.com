<p>If you could analyse all your email, or all your organisation&rsquo;s email, in any way, what would you do with it? Leave a comment with your answers.</p>

<h2>Email Analytics For You</h2>

<ul>
<li>Build a stats dashboard with total number of emails sent, sent per day, top recipients, etc, and start a competition to see who sends the most (or least!)</li>
<li>Calculate what time you&rsquo;re most likely to get a response from a particular person</li>
<li>Extract all the links you&rsquo;ve sent and make a Twitter feed</li>
<li>Extract all the links you&rsquo;ve sent or received to a particular person and show them in a sidebar when composing (a bit like <a href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive</a>)</li>
<li>Build a cool visualisation of your email social network, like <a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/">InMaps</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Email Analytics For Your Organisation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trending topics</li>
<li>Integrate with a CRM, e.g. automatically populate contacts, history</li>
<li>Pull attachments and share them on Dropbox/GDocs/file server/etc (similar to <a href="http://attachments.me">attachments.me</a>)</li>
<li>Extract stealth documentation (questions and answers) and add it to a wiki</li>
<li>Archive conversations applying custom rules (filter out mailing lists, large attachments)</li>
<li>Detect specific content, e.g. porn, law-breaking, bullying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Email Analytics For The World</h2>

<p>By analysing the all the email in the world (or a sufficiently large volume thereof), you could apply the kind of social analytics that Twitter, Facebook, Bitly, PeerIndex, etc, provide.</p>

<ul>
<li>Trending topics</li>
<li>Influence (&ldquo;Ben knows about startups&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Contact segmentation</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on. What would you do?</p>
