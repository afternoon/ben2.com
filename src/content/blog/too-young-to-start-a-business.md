<p>The ever fascinating Library House bloggers have compiled a <a href="http://www.libraryhouse.net/blog/2007/05/08/too-old-to-start-a-business/">graph of startup founder ages</a> from data in their VenturePedia database.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 28 now. I&rsquo;m currently working in my second and third startups. While I could only really call myself a founder of the first business, the now dead Cohack, I&rsquo;m as close as dammit in the other two.</p>

<p>I often wondered about this question: am I behind the curve or ahead of it? Library House&rsquo;s data suggests the answer is well ahead. They don&rsquo;t reveal too much, but of more than 600 founders, about 10 were in the 25-29 age bracket. 1 in 60 isn&rsquo;t bad. Indeed, the curve will be bearing down on me for  at least another 10 years yet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m inclined to see this more as youthful rashness on my part than precociousness. I probably should have spent longer kow-towing my way through established organisations and learning my trade a bit more. Successful entrepreneurship often seems to follow the Salesforce.com model, their two founders were both successful Oracle staffers before starting out on their own. Then again there&rsquo;s always the Larry-and-Sergey/Chad-and-Steve/David-and-Jerry model, but I&rsquo;m ancient for that.</p>

<p>A final note on the data. Library House&rsquo;s data comes from companies seeking funding. It is possible, even likely, that there are more companies founded by younger kids, but they&rsquo;re less likely to be looking for funding, have the skills to even pass the initial requirements to get into the DB, etc. I should also mention that I have yet have a successful business, but we&rsquo;re all working hard on it.</p>
