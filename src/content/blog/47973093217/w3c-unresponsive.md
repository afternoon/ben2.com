<p>I had another tiff on www-style today. Somebody asked about block-level centering (both vertical and horizontal). I think this is the fourth or fifth time somebody has out of the blue come on to the list and asked about block centering, there <em>is</em> a need for it, but nothing is being done. The people who represent the working group can&rsquo;t even be bothered to come on to the list and talk about it. I can kind of understand this, it&rsquo;s an old issue. By why is nothing being done? Why is there no process for resolving these kind of suggestions formally? Is the W3C at all interactive? At the moment it seems to be asleep. The people who argue with me on the lists are just other people following the mantra of &ldquo;The Right Way&rdquo;. Where&rsquo;s the plan of action? I don&rsquo;t want to still be having these arguments in a year&rsquo;s time. I want to move forward and I hope they do too.</p>
