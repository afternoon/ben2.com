<p>Louise bought me a big tub of Yeo Valley organic Raspberry yoghurt as part of this week&rsquo;s shopping. It is the fittest yoghurt ever. It&rsquo;s so good. The whole tub has gone within less than 24 hours of opening. It was as much as I could to not just eat the whole lot last night.</p>
<p>Then, when I threw the pack away it had details of recycling on the inside, but also gave me the URL of a <a href="http://uk2.multimap.com/clients/places.cgi?client=valpak">recycling point locator</a>. We already recycle, but we don&rsquo;t know anywhere to recycle plastics at the moment, which is a big part part of our rubbish.</p>
