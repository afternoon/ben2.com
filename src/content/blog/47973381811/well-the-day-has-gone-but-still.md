<p>The whole moving thing is slowing now. For three days Tom, Louise and I have been piling, sorting, moving and faffing all manner of crap and a whole lot of it to. We&rsquo;re beginning to feel more at home, the jungle, which started off fairly quiet, is getting louder progressively :-).</p>
<p>Tonight we did the walk to the tube to meet Dan and Nikki, we went to the pub next to Parson&rsquo;s Green for food. Man the food! Duck salad with panchetta and potatoes. It was really nice but not exactly what I expected from pub food. Fulham is pretty much the porsche town I expected and that kind of makes me a bit like a stereotype, but then I don&rsquo;t look like any of the suit-wearers in the pub. However, none of the bar staff are going to be saying goodbye at the end of the night like you would in the King&rsquo;s Arms.</p>
<p>The radio stations are a lot better though&hellip;</p>
