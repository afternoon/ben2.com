<p>Netscape sucks ass, everybody knows this. However, Hypo should probably be tested a bit more on Netscape to ensure useability. This is mainly a theme thing - Kurish and Legacy both definitely have problems, other probably do also.</p>
<p>For some reason, the file list on the profile page doesn&rsquo;t have any links to look at/download the files. This is retarded.</p>
