<p>I just had a conversation with one of my managers about the need for project managers and specifications. He totally understood the need for careful management of projects and I was very happy to hear that it sounds like he will be taking steps to take the weight of management off my shoulders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard because managing all the phone calls and collating demands and verifying problems takes up a lot of my time, but that&rsquo;s because it needs somebody who&rsquo;s very familiar with the project to do it and nobody else has been available. I spent as much time on the phone last week as I did coding. Software is complicated and good seperation of roles helps simplify the development process. I get much more done when I&rsquo;m given a list of tasks and I can just get my head down and do them. It also means that if things need to be rescheduled, it&rsquo;s not a case of me saying sorry I didn&rsquo;t get it done, because the project manager is so close to the developers they hold a stake in getting it done right and will help take the responsibility of updating the project plan and make sure it stays workable.</p>
<p>I also sent my first invoice since June. My shares earnings have alleviated the urgency of invoicing. This one was the biggest I&rsquo;ve ever sent, by a factor of three.</p>
