<p>Nielsen advocates the use of different layouts and configurations for different devices and users, so does Tullis! The guest user can be bounced between several versions of the default theme for different hardware configs, i.e. WebTV, PDA, even WML can be thought of as an especially cut down version of the default theme. Then, when the user is logged in, certain themes can be recommended for certain browsers and a simple sanity check can be performed before sending the page. I.e. if they default to a basic HTML page they would still get a WML page if they used a phone. Setting the decision barriers will be tricky.</p>
<p>Need to test the PHP browscap.ini functions, if they can be used they&rsquo;d be great. Browser detection and what to do when we&rsquo;ve identified the capabilities is a grey area that is going to need testing to get the best results.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think people should probably be logged in for longer. Maybe a few days or something. Perhaps a tick box in the config: &ldquo;When I log in, I wanna stay logged in, god damn it.&rdquo;</p>
