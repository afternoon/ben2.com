<p>I really enjoyed reading Yann Martel&rsquo;s very popular book. I don&rsquo;t read much fiction which means I almost always enjoy it, but this was particularly satisfying in a way that Pi himself would understand.</p>
<p>The story is just out of reach of normality but not so far that it ever becomes really implausible. As a scientist (it&rsquo;s my religion rather than my profession per se) I quickly become uncomfortable without reasonable argument to justify changes to the universe. Martel&rsquo;s fine-grained world carries plenty of that, viewed through Pi&rsquo;s steady observations. A lot of people might have found it a bit of a slog, with the fairly meticulous descriptions of which parts of a turtle are edible and the habits of animals both in zoos and the wild, but I loved sharing the wonder that Pi finds in everything nature offers him. In addition all the momentum of Pi&rsquo;s rich world, gathered through the book, is spent marvelously well in the last fifty pages, more than justifying any earlier wanderings.</p>
