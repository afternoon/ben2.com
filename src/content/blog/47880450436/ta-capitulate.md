<p>TextAmerica have announced that they will not delete free accounts after all. This text appears on their <a href="http://www.textamerica.com/admin/login_page.aspx?inner=0&amp;_lmk=%2fadmin%2fDefault.aspx%3f">login page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>We are pleased to announce: In light of recent changes and the outpour of positive support, textamerica will continue to provide free memberships to users. In celebration of our existing users that have recently upgraded, all accounts upgraded on or before 7/15/06 will hold “Founding Memberships” with special VIP privileges not available to other users. We are currently finalizing stipulations to new &amp; existing memberships, terms and conditions to be announced 7/8/06. In honor of your greatly appreciated enthusiasm and participation in helping to keep the community strong, the “lifetime membership” contest will continue until the new TA is finalized (contest.textamerica.com). Thank You.</blockquote>
<p>Not sure there was an &ldquo;outpour of positive support&rdquo; or even a whiff of it. This is good news for the people who&rsquo;s pictures will be preserved, but the whole episode does leave a bad aftertaste.</p>
