<p>Another invoice out of the door! WOO HOO! This one is sizeable enough that it should put me back on my feet properly until about February. Which is a fucking relief. The last month has been very lean and I&rsquo;ve incurred a few nasty penalties from my bank.</p>
<p>Not only have I invoiced two jobs this week, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that I can invoice another two next week. Yes they&rsquo;ll be much smaller, but it&rsquo;s the thought that counts.</p>
