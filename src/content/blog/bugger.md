<p>After asking the WG to explain their thoughts on CCSS, Hixie said he didn&rsquo;t understand it and that a proposal in the form of a CSS 3 module with lots of examples would go a long way to solving that problem.</p>
<p>Why should I be writing out proposals on my budget of no money? The W3C has a large budget. I&rsquo;ve identified some problems and I&rsquo;m willing to both identify and catalog more. Call me naive but I thought it would be up to the W3C to go about the business of finding solutions. Oh well, that&rsquo;s another drain on my time.</p>
