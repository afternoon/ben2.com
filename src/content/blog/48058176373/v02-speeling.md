<p>pspell is enabled on Gradwell, using it is as easy as a short call that takes the message, and runs pspell_check on every non-HTML word. The results can be output with speeling mistaks highlighted somehow. Correcting means correctin based on suggestions (a la that spell check site?) and may mean correcting away from the original word, correcting names etc. or even [sharp intake of breath] correcting colour to color!</p>
<p>No, background-color: red; will do.</p>
