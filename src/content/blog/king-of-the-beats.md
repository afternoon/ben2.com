<p>I&rsquo;m scratching. It&rsquo;s my decks and Mat&rsquo;s mixer, as per reality. I&rsquo;m scratching with something quite ambient, it reminds me of Tortoise&rsquo;s mix of Beats and Pieces 2, but not quite. The other deck has some beats of some kind on it. I&rsquo;m scratching really well, making a nice rythm. However, when I look from one deck to the other the needle is moving around a lot. Maybe this is just time passing, or maybe my turntables are conspiring to scratch with me. Either way, it all still sounds pretty good.</p>
