<p>Louise won free tickets to see <em><a href="http://www.whereisnemo.co.uk/">Finding Nemo</a></em> this morning at eleven. The theatre was alive with squirming kids. There was a small amount of screaming. The beginning of the film was quite harsh really. I saw the whole place erupting in tears in a sort of domino effect, but they kept it together mostly.</p>
<p>The film itself was typically likeable, with a good number of razor sharp one liners. The main characters were a bit of a trial at times, Ellen DeGeneres was a bit squawky and the other character wasn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> loveable, but the large range of supplementary characters made up for that. The story was well written, moving along quite quickly, characters coming in for only a few scenes. It&rsquo;s really nice to see a kid&rsquo;s film where the plot is in no way predictable. Hey, and it&rsquo;s always fun to guess the voices in big animated films. I enjoyed it a lot but it wasn&rsquo;t quite as good as Monsters Inc.</p>
<p>After the film, I dragged Louise around Rough Trade and Koobla. Picked up the new Matmos album, <em>The Civil War</em>, the new LFO, <em>Sheath</em>, and some jungle plates. I had a little mix an hour or so ago and I&rsquo;m really loving Drumsound and Simon Bassline Smith&rsquo;s <em>Junglist</em> ATM. Will report on the electronica later.</p>
