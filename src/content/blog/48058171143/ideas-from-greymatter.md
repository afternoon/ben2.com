<p><a href="http://www.noahgrey.com/greysoft/features.shtml">Greymatter</a> is a particuarly feature packed blog package. Has things like karma and stuff. It can do on-the-fly skin changes with CSS.</p>
<blockquote><p>Literally dozens of configuration options&hellip;</p></blockquote>
<p>Archiving by month, week with indices. Searching,</p>
<p>It has here style comments, which are no good for Hype, IMHO. They just take content away from the front page.</p>
<p>Collapsing: With the Hype2 style of portlets there&rsquo;s no reason not to have close icons on the optional portlets. Just shortcuts to modify your config record doofer. It&rsquo;s tempting to go for Slashdot-style re-ordering buttons, but they&rsquo;re really slow &lsquo;cos they require so many reloads. A better idea would be a set of 3 list boxes somewhere in the profile section.</p>
