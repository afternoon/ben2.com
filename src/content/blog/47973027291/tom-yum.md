<p>I made Tom Yum soup. A spicy citrusy Thai soup. I made it with two recipes and some &ldquo;innovation&rdquo;. It was good but I used chicken stock as the base which was OK except it was a bit greasy and a bit strongly flavoured. I also stuck too much lime juice into it, it came out with those flavours grossly blocking out most of the others. This is the usual outcome when I cook, it comes out brash and over-flavoured. I need to learn subtlety.</p>
