<p>I have updated the graphic. This is still not totally what I envisaged, but I think it acheives everything I wanted to acheive, the most important things being the colours and the little bubble guy. I&rsquo;m pleased with him, he&rsquo;s come out very much as I wanted him to, which is always nice as I&rsquo;m not the handiest illustrator. I thought I would have to use Lightwave or something to model him to get the perspective, but I managed to flange it using the pathfinders and the offset path function in Illustrator. Woo!</p>
