<p>I made a middle C with SDL. It&rsquo;s very basic. I allocate a buffer which is 172 samples long - which happens to be the wavelength of middle C when playing at 44khz. Then I dump than buffer on to the sound card repeatedly.</p>
<p>I would have expected the result to be a nice crisp clear tone, but no, it&rsquo;s more like FM.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how synthesisers are made.</p>
