<p>Kill Bill was as I expected.</p>
<p>It was quite different from other Tarantino movies, having practically no dialogue. The violence was good, I liked it, but then I really like all the old kung fu films and anime. It had all the camera angles etc, but it was empty. It was a bit dull.</p>
<p>I found the dramatic pauses over-long. Instead of sitting on the edge my seat, I looked around at the audience. As Louise said, Japan and katanas aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;just cool&rdquo; anymore. They&rsquo;ve been used in to many hip hop videos and Kill Bill relied on us just being in awe of everything it showed us. It looked like the Matrix without the sci fi and got away with less because you kind of expect more from Tarantino than the Wachowskis.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was pretty good.</p>
