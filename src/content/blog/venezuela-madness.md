<p>Pat Robertson, a US TV preacher (;-) <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article307946.ece">called for the assasination of Hugo Chavez</a>, the president of Venezuela, on his 700 club TV show. This is not crazy enough on it&rsquo;s own. No no, he had to bring in the spectre of the pinko commies and wahhabists, accusing Chavez of turning Venezuela into &ldquo;the launching pad for communist infiltration and Muslim extremism.&rdquo; This just defies belief really, but it&rsquo;s especially stupid when you consider that Robertson is head of an organisation that claims to have 2 million members in the US and was instrumental in getting Bush elected in at least one state.</p>
