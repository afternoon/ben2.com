<p>Had a bit of a crazy night tonight. Ben Tullis is attending a week long course on C++ in London for work and had to catch a train at 6:30. He&rsquo;d left his bag at Thickthorn so I offered to drive him to the station via there. At dawn I&rsquo;m usually slipping away, but after &frac34; hour driving I&rsquo;m nearly dead. Oh well, he got his train OK and lent me his camera to boot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also added two things to my content section. One is the <a href="http://aftnn.org/content/birthdaygirl/">game I made for Louise&rsquo;s birthday</a> last year. It&rsquo;s javascript and very very very simple, but it was hanging around on Hype still and I thought it would be more at home where it is now.</p>
<p>The other item today is <a href="http://aftnn.org/content/blocks/">Blocks</a>. I&rsquo;ve been doing some design for a client, using the old 45 angles and primary colours. I find trying to do real design quite inspiring. If I mess up and rotate 60 or apply some kind of explosive filter in Illustrator the results are unusable but look really good. Blocks is a prime example, I&rsquo;ve taken the elements from my commercial work and created an interactive Flash toy that has no usefulness whatsoever. Move your mouse to make the colours change.</p>
