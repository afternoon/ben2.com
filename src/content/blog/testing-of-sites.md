<p>In many ways Soup&rsquo;s test room is a lie. The machines all run fairly recent versions of Internet Explorer, none of them are seriously underpowered and none of them are in regular production use. This means that no-one changes their fonts or installs an office bar or anything so heinous. It also means the res creeps up to 1024 once in a while. A much better way to test a product is on site. That major shoe company site I developed would have launched a day earlier if we had gone on-site and tested on their machines. Their MD had a copy of IE 4 which we can&rsquo;t get because it&rsquo;s Win 95 only. I think the same applies to Flash and Director.</p>
<p>An additional benefit is that if errors do occur they can be fixed then and there to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction. No more ringing up and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed it, can you check it again for me? OK, so, right, what&rsquo;s it doing now? [cue 5 minute description of something unrelated to the error].</p>
<p>Test on-site, even if you hate them and it&rsquo;s fucking miles away.</p>
