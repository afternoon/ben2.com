<p>Getting back into the routine of everyday blogging, it makes no sense to block blog activity until I&rsquo;m ready to do the holiday post, that way leads to never blogging again :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I just had a first round telephone interview with International Consultation MegaCorp <a href="http://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a>. They are recruiting a fairly large number of software people to work on big projects within their technology services department (I think).</p>
<p>The questions focussed on my goals, they asked why I applied, as expected, but also a bit about why I might want to leave freelance and stuff. I answered all this pretty easily. They have big projects, I want to be part of a big software project team. The tricksy one was a question about mobility. The initial form had mentioned this and had ticked the equivalent of &ldquo;Mobile? Of course!&rdquo; But then she asked what I thought they meant. It was either going to be mobile within London, nationally or internationally and I gave her my views on each of them. I said I was happy to do international and local travel and I didn&rsquo;t rule out national travel completely, although I did imply that I wasn&rsquo;t raring to spend 3 months working in Newcastle or something like that.</p>
<p>As I get older it is easier to tell where my weaknesses lie. In this situation it&rsquo;s going to be the travel thing, though it&rsquo;s difficult to say what the competition will be like there. Also, they may well just think that I don&rsquo;t have enough experience for the role. My paper experience is not great, I feel it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the breadth and depth of my skills as a software engineer. I know I&rsquo;m not the best, but I think I&rsquo;m good enough to put my foot in the door and keep it there on a big project. My focus for my next career move is definitely to find something that will look good on paper and Accenture is nothing if not that.</p>
