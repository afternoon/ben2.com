<p>The comment system is up. It has a nasty bug that reposts if you refresh. I&rsquo;ll have to see if I get defeat that with header cleverness.</p>
<p>The last few bits I&rsquo;ve changed have added a degree of me-less-ness. Basically I&rsquo;ve begun the process of abstracting the code to support generalisation and packaging. We&rsquo;re going to use a config file in the protected folder to store user data. Functions read and write the parameters in the file. It will also contain sensitive data. The file will have a page to configure it completely, allowing configuration of the database also. This page will be in the protected folder also, so the product will ship with a default password for the folder and allow it to be changed from the setup page. Essentially this page should attempt to work in all situations and allow the product to be configured head to toe in a wizard kind of way.</p>
<p>Gotta think of a name, comments on a weblog to&hellip;</p>
