<p>I&rsquo;ve just been playing <em>Metroid Prime</em> for the last couple of hours. I was playing the section where you get the thermal visor. Suddenly everything goes black, so you switch on the visor. This is not much better.</p>
<p>Before I bought <em>Metroid</em>, I read a <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=4515">Eurogamer review</a> where the guy said the feeling he got while playing it was the feeling he got when playing <em>Doom</em>. I wasn&rsquo;t sure before, but reading that made me buy it. It really is like playing <em>Doom</em>.</p>
<p>When I first got <em>Doom</em> (one HD, one DD, of course) I played it through. It shat me up. It has a very similar bit, which I&rsquo;ll never forget, where it&rsquo;s just pitch black and you&rsquo;re just letting off rounds and it&rsquo;s basically a maze and there&rsquo;s all kinds of nastiness in there and then you get the light amp and it&rsquo;s all OK. I just remember hearing the sounds of demons off in the distance whilst playing <em>Doom</em> late at night and being really scared. I was about 14. Now I&rsquo;m 25 and the sounds of Space Pirates patrolling somewhere where I can&rsquo;t see them in a huge dark room scares me almost as much. Ain&rsquo;t life grand.</p>
