<p>Today I reached M6 for Hype and put the site up so people can play with it! Finally, after all these years, it being almost three years to the day since I first put Hype up.</p>
<p>I got a lot of feedback, lots of positive comments, some bugs and some keen exploration of the potential and operation of some of the new features I&rsquo;ve put in. Link title grabbing, a recent addition to the feature set, got much attention. At the moment the system tries to grab the titles from everything, 404&rsquo;s, MP3&rsquo;s, flash files, you name it. I just hadn&rsquo;t thought about it thoroughly enough and my test data was wholly inadequete to highlight the problem.</p>
<p>Oh man, so much stuff went on today. The old Hype is kind of already dead, people are posting to the new one instead, even though nothing&rsquo;s there. I&rsquo;d better port the data across fairly soon otherwise it will take on a life of it&rsquo;s own!</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve got a list of about 15 things to go through in response to today alone. That&rsquo;s on top of all the things I had anyway. But it&rsquo;s all good stuff. What worries me is that now the system is visible I&rsquo;m loosing the burn. But I&rsquo;ve fought on through this for a while. What I wonder is how much work I&rsquo;ll do in the next six months. Will my list be complete by Christmas? It could be.</p>
<p>As for now, I&rsquo;m pretty worn out. Do a bit of hacking I think then pass out and get back to it tomorrow in earnest.</p>
