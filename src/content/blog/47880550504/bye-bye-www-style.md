<p>I unsubbed from <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">www-style</a>. it&rsquo;s really high volume at the moment with the 2.1 comments and stuff and it&rsquo;s all really boring.</p>
<p>Plus I realised that they don&rsquo;t really make the rules. They have done in the past, but now they seem more interested in writing specifications for concepts agreed in the browser-space (to some extent at least). Secondly, they never, ever, listened to my POV anyway. Oh well.</p>
