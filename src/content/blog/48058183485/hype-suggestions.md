<p>There&rsquo;s that little reloader issue. Can javascript check the server? Is it possible to say something like blah = contentsOfURL(&ldquo;hypothetical.co.uk&rdquo;)? If not then the problem could be solved using a frame of some sort or other (document.frames.monkeyframe.href = &ldquo;hype&rdquo;; if (updateTime(monkeyframe) &gt; oldUpdateTime) reloadmainframe();).</p>
<p>The other one is to get down to tuning autolinks a bit. Possibly, as Chon suggests by mangling the number of clicks a link is given depending on the link age, i.e. a click on a decrepit link means big points. This has the advantage that the sorting can still be done by MySQL. The title lookup system still needs finishing as well. See Hype for another notes along these lines.</p>
