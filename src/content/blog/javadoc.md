<p>I&rsquo;ve just been writing a bunch of documentation for some of the behind-the-scenes classes in <a href="http://www.wwwebflow.com">wwWebflow</a> using <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/">Javadoc</a>. Javadoc is pretty neat and I very much like seeing my own classes through the lens of those familiar looking pages. I particularly like the fact that because Javadoc reads the code and automatically documents the public interfaces, all the what is already provided and I only have to provide the why.</p>
