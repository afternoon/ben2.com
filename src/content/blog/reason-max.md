<p>With Reason, you have a virtual rack on synth and production gear. Flip it around and you can change how the rack is connected together.</p>

<p>With Max you build sound processes from the ground up.</p>

<p>What if in Reason you could not just flip the rack around but could also crack each box open and resolder it&rsquo;s internals, Max-style.</p>

<p>That would be coool.</p>
