<p>Yesterday, there were three seperate copyright victories (the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/31891.html">MIT rebuke to the RIAA subpoenas</a>, the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/23/1058853121030.html">complaint by OSV against SCO</a> and the <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1028_3-5053421.html?tag=fd_top">House of Reps rebuke to the new FCC media regs</a>), it was a good day.</p>
<p>Last night I had a dream where I was with a scientist who&rsquo;s work was measuring some coefficient of the world. He measured it to about 1.3. I was told by shady types (Illuminati-level shady) that it was actually 1.5. As soon as I told the scientist this, the world began to spin more quickly and was struck by huge storms with furious winds and masses of lightening. It was actually moderately scary, the scariest dream I&rsquo;ve had for ages.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://ninj4.org/blog/entry?1059060961">Mat&rsquo;s remaining grandmother died</a> and Adam&rsquo;s old dog Ted was put down.</p>
<p>I did read <em><a href="http://www.gizmology.net/lovecraft/works/cthulhu.htm">The Call Of Cthulhu</a></em> recently, but I sense a disturbance in the force&hellip;</p>
