<p>Well, it&rsquo;s finally here. <a href="http://www.textually.org/picturephoning/archives/2006/03/011900.htm">Orange Israel is planning to offer their customers the option to reduce their phone bills by watching ads</a>. I infered that this was going to happen a couple of months ago, which makes me sound all on the pulse and super-business-savvy, but really, it was pretty obvious. Advertising revenues have been proven so successfully online that it was really only a matter of time.</p>
<p>But will it actually work? Mobiles are personal devices. When I sit down at a computer to browse or a TV to view I&rsquo;m entering the fray and I may be more willing to put up with messages from the outside world. Not so with my phone, it&rsquo;s within a metre of me 24/7, I don&rsquo;t step outside it&rsquo;s reach, so I&rsquo;m more sensitive to invasions caused by it. Traditionally my mobile phone has not been portal to outside content, but a link to a select group of trusted individuals, my friends, family and a select group of work contacts. These are people that I have spent a lot of time vetting and even then I sometimes groan when they ring :-). If somebody outside my mental whitelist calls me, more often than not the call finishes with &ldquo;Can you remove my name from your database please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that Orange are showing the ads only when people go out into the mobile net, in this case by playing a game, <cite>Celltrix</cite>, in the pilot at least. This will certainly keep the invasiveness of the ads to a minimum and so people will be more willing to sign up. This will be an interesting experiment though and I expect lots of eyes are on it, not least those of the <a href="http://www.google.com/">G</a><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Y</a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">M</a> club.</p>
